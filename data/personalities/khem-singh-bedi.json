      "value": "Khem Singh Bedi was born on 21 February 1832 in Kallar Syedan, Rawalpindi District, into the Bedi family, which claimed direct descent from Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. He was the 13th in this purported line, following his ancestor Baba Sahib Singh Bedi. His father, Baba Attar Singh, was killed in a family feud on 25 November 1839, leaving young Khem and his elder brother Sampuran Singh to inherit jagirs (land grants) in the Doaba region and 41 villages in Depalpur Tehsil. Following the British annexation of Punjab in 1849, 14 villages were confiscated by the East India Company administration. Bedi received jagirs in 4 villages of Dipalpur tahsil, while his brother held 22. This early loss shaped his role as a landowner navigating colonial rule. Historical context includes the turbulent post-Sikh Empire era under Ranjit Singh's successors and British expansion."

      "value": "Bedi was a key supporter of education during British rule. In 1855, he backed the Punjab Department of Public Instruction's initiative to open 30 single-teacher primary schools, personally funding schools in Rawalpindi and assisting in establishing at least 50 schools for boys and girls across Punjab. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, he aided British forces in quelling an uprising in Gugera, leading a cavalry charge on 21 September 1857 and escaping an ambush the next day that killed a British official. For his loyalty, he received a robe of honor and a double-barreled rifle. In 1873, he co-founded the Amritsar Singh Sabha, the first in the Singh Sabha Movement, to counter Christian, Muslim, Arya Samaj, and Brahmo Samaj proselytizing. The Sabha promoted an inclusive Sikh identity drawing from Hinduism and Islam. Bedi also constructed the Bedi Haveli (Bedi Mahal) in Kallar Syedan, featuring intricate frescoes, as a symbol of his status. Politically, he served as a magistrate (1877), Companion of the Indian Empire (1879), member of the Imperial Legislative Council (1893), and KCIE (1898). He expanded his landholdings to 28,272 acres in Montgomery District alone."

      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "As a Sanatan Sikh (\"Traditional Sikh\"), Bedi advocated that there were no essential differences between Sikhs and Hindus, rejecting the exclusive authority of the Guru Granth Sahib as the sole guru in favor of human gurus. He positioned himself as a spiritual guide (Gaddi Nashin), drawing from the 19th-century Dasam Granth. This stance clashed with the emerging Tat Khalsa (\"pure Khalsa\") faction, which emphasized Khalsa orthodoxy. In response to his claims, reformers removed his gaddi (high seat) from the Golden Temple's parikarma in the 1880s, symbolizing rejection of hereditary guruship. Bedi's reforms focused on charitable causes, education, and maintaining Sikh traditions amid colonial influences, including donations of Rs 300,000 at his daughter's 1893 marriage for religious purposes."

He died on 10 April 1905 in Montgomery (present-day Sahiwal, Pakistan), leaving a legacy of estates, including the Bedi Haveli, which preserves frescoes depicting Sikh history."

    "description": "Khem Singh Bedi's legacy is tied to the early Singh Sabha Movement, where he championed a syncretic Sanatan Sikhism that preserved Hindu-Sikh continuities and hereditary spiritual authority. However, his self-proclaimed guruship contributed to internal Sikh debates on orthodoxy, ultimately favoring the scriptural authority of the Guru Granth Sahib over human descendants.",
    "keyContributions": [
      "Founded Amritsar Singh Sabha (1873), initiating organized Sikh revivalism against missionary activities.",
      "Promoted education and charity, establishing schools and donating vast sums to Sikh institutions.",
