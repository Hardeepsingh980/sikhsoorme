      "value": "Baba Gurmukh Singh was born in 1888 in the village of Lalton Khurd (sources vary slightly with Lalton Kalan) in the Ludhiana district of Punjab, under British colonial rule. He came from a modest Sikh farming family. He received his early education at a local primary school and completed matriculation at the Church Mission School in Ludhiana, where he was a schoolmate of the prominent Ghadar leader Kartar Singh Sarabha. This period exposed him to ideas of nationalism and Sikh identity amid growing anti-colonial sentiments. As a young man, he aspired to join the British Indian Army but was rejected due to medical reasons. In 1913, seeking opportunities abroad like many Punjabi youth, he left home with limited funds, initially heading to Hong Kong en route to Canada."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Gurmukh Singh's contributions were pivotal in the Ghadar Movement, a revolutionary organization formed by Punjabi diaspora in North America to overthrow British rule through mutinies in the Indian Army. In 1914, he joined the ill-fated Komagata Maru voyage, chartered by Baba Gurdit Singh to challenge Canada's discriminatory \"continuous journey\" immigration laws targeting South Asians. The ship, carrying 376 mostly Sikh passengers, was denied entry in Vancouver and forced to return to India, where a violent clash at Budge Budge near Calcutta resulted in 22 deaths. Gurmukh Singh escaped the confrontation but was captured three days later and imprisoned in Alipur Jail, Calcutta.  \nUpon transfer to Punjab, he connected with Ghadar leaders like Kartar Singh Sarabha and Rash Behari Bose. He attempted to incite rebellions by secretly contacting Indian soldiers in Punjab cantonments, aiming to spark a pan-India uprising during World War I. Betrayed by a colleague, he was arrested in 1915 and tried in the First Lahore Conspiracy Case (1916), resulting in a life sentence to Cellular Jail (Kala Pani) in the Andaman Islands‚Äîa notorious penal colony for political prisoners. There, he endured brutal conditions from 1917 to 1922.  \nHis service extended internationally: After escaping in 1922, he traveled to Kabul, Afghanistan, via the Khyber Pass with Teja Singh Swatantar, preaching Sikh ideals and revolutionary socialism. Influenced by publications like *Kirti*, he visited Soviet Russia in 1924 for training in revolutionary tactics alongside Baba Prithvi Singh. He then reorganized Ghadar networks in the United States (1925‚Äì1929), raising funds and inspiring activists in California. Arrested briefly by U.S. authorities but bailed out, he journeyed through Europe, Kenya (on a fake passport), and West Asia, attending the Indian National Congress's Karachi session in 1931 but growing disillusioned with its moderate pace. He returned to India incognito, working underground for revolutionary groups like Lal Dora, before another arrest in the 1930s led to renewed imprisonment until 1946."

He promoted anti-colonial education among Punjabis, critiquing racial discrimination faced by South Asians abroad (e.g., Komagata Maru). Post-independence, he focused on peasants' rights, activating the Kisan Sabha (farmers' union) and establishing the Desh Bhagat Yadgar (Martyrs' Memorial Hall) in Jalandhar in the 1950s to honor freedom fighters, preserving revolutionary history and inspiring future generations."

Baba Gurmukh Singh passed away on March 13, 1977, at age 89, remembered as \"Gadri Baba\" for his indomitable spirit."
