      "value": "Rai Bular Bhatti was born around 1425 into the Bhatti Rajput clan, inheriting the zamindari (feudal lordship) of Talwandi from his father, Rai Bhoi (or Bhoe) Bhatti (c. 1380‚Äì1454/1461). His ancestors, originally from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, had migrated to Punjab in the early 14th century following defeats during the Delhi Sultanate's expansions under rulers like Alauddin Khalji. Converted to Islam, the family was granted fertile lands in Punjab as compensation. Rai Bhoi rebuilt the village of Talwandi (previously Raipur) after devastation from invasions, including those by Timur, establishing it as a prosperous settlement. Under Rai Bular's leadership from the mid-15th century, Talwandi flourished as an administrative center. As zamindar, he employed locals, including Mehta Kalu, a patwari (accountant), whose son, Guru Nanak, was born in the village in 1469. Historical context places his early life amid the Lodhi dynasty's rule in the Delhi Sultanate, marked by feudal obligations and regional stability in Punjab."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Rai Bular's most significant contributions were to the nascent Sikh faith through his patronage of Guru Nanak. As the employer of Mehta Kalu, he interacted closely with the young Guru from childhood. He recognized Nanak's spiritual gifts early, becoming one of his first devotees. Key acts include mediating disputes involving Nanak, such as the 1490s incident where Nanak's cattle herd allegedly damaged crops‚Äîupon investigation, no damage was found, affirming Nanak's miraculous protection (citation: Janamsakhi traditions). He witnessed the \"shadow miracle,\" where the tree under which Nanak slept cast no moving shadow despite the sun's path, interpreted as divine intervention. Rai Bular donated half his estate‚Äîover 18,500 acres of prime agricultural land‚Äîto support Guru Nanak's teachings and travels, enabling the establishment of sites now central to Sikh pilgrimage, including Nankana Sahib. This land, originally part of his feudal holdings, symbolized interfaith harmony and secular support for spiritual reform. His service extended to local governance, ensuring Talwandi's security and growth during a period of Mughal precursor tensions."

His zamindari passed to descendants, who maintained influence in the region. The donated lands became sacred Sikh sites, underscoring his enduring legacy."
