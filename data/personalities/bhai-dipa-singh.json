      "value": "Bhai Deep Singh was born on January 26, 1682 (14 Maagh 1739 Bikrami), in Pahuwind village, near Amritsar, to devout Sikh parents Bhagta Ji (a farmer) and Jeoni Ji. As their only child, he was named Deepa, symbolizing light. At age 12, his family visited Anandpur Sahib, where Guru Gobind Singh requested him to stay and serve the Sikh community. For eight years, he studied Gurmukhi, Sikh philosophy, and scriptures under Bhai Mani Singh, while training in horsemanship, archery, and weaponry. At 18, he received Amrit from the Panj Pyare on Vaisakhi, adopting the name Deep Singh and committing to the Khalsa vows of protecting the weak and upholding justice. In 1702, he returned to Pahuwind, married, and assisted his aging parents amid rising Mughal persecution of Sikhs."

      "value": "Bhai Deep Singh's life was marked by scholarly and martial service to the Panth. In 1705, at Damdama Sahib, he collaborated with Bhai Mani Singh to compile the final text of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, reciting Guru Gobind Singh's version and producing five handwritten copies for distribution to Takhts (Akal Takht, Patna Sahib, Hazur Sahib, Kesgarh Sahib) and one in Arabic script for the Middle East. Appointed head Granthi at Damdama Sahib in 1706, he preached Sikh teachings, authored gutkas (hymn books), and organized community service. In 1709, he joined Banda Singh Bahadur in the Battle of Sirhind, avenging the martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's younger sons. As leader of the Shahid Misl (from 1733), he expanded Sikh influence south of the Sutlej River, rescuing 300+ women and children from Ahmad Shah Abdali's forces in 1756 near Kurukshetra. He survived the Chotta Ghalughara in 1755 and fortified Sikh resistance against Mughal invasions."

      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhai Deep Singh played a pivotal role in preserving Sikh identity and scriptures during persecution. He established the Damdami Taksal as a center for Gurbani education, ensuring the accurate dissemination of Guru Granth Sahib. His leadership in the Dal Khalsa (1733) helped organize Sikhs into misls for administrative and military efficiency, fostering unity against oppression. He promoted Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct) through preaching, emphasizing saint-soldier ideals (sant-sipahi). His missions, like the 1756 rescue operation, highlighted Sikh commitment to human rights, freeing captives regardless of faith and challenging Mughal tyranny without religious bias."

      "value": "Primarily a scribe and educator, Bhai Deep Singh did not author original compositions but meticulously copied and distributed Sikh scriptures. He produced over five volumes of Sri Guru Granth Sahib in Gurmukhi and one in Abjad (Arabic) script to reach broader audiences, including Muslim regions. He also wrote gutkas containing Gurbani hymns for community use. His scholarly work under Bhai Mani Singh included annotations and explanations of complex texts, aiding Sikh literacy. No independent writings survive, but his scribal contributions ensured the Guru Granth Sahib's integrity (citation: SikhiWiki, Bhagata Singh, 1993)."

      "value": "In his later years, at age 75, Bhai Deep Singh focused on defending Amritsar amid Ahmad Shah Abdali's invasions. In May 1757, after Mughals under Jahan Khan defiled the Harimander Sahib sarovar and destroyed Ram Rauni fortress, he mobilized 5,000 Sikhs. At Tarn Taran, he drew a line with his khanda, reciting Guru Gobind Singh's shabad on love and sacrifice, allowing only the resolute to cross. Leading a small force against 20,000 Mughals, he fought valiantly near Goharwal. Severely wounded and beheaded by Jamal Khan, he miraculously picked up his head, placed it on his palm, and advanced to the Golden Temple, reciting Japji Sahib, fulfilling his vow. He attained martyrdom on November 13, 1757, on the parikarma of Harimander Sahib, inspiring Sikh victory."

  "spiritualLegacy": {
    "description": "Bhai Deep Singh's legacy embodies the Sikh ethos of miri-piri (temporal-spiritual balance), blending profound scholarship with fearless warfare. As the first Jathedar of Damdami Taksal (founded by Guru Gobind Singh), he institutionalized Gurbani education, producing enduring copies of the Guru Granth Sahib that form the bedrock of Sikh worship today. His martyrdom symbolizes ultimate devotion, reinforcing the Khalsa's role as protectors of dharam (righteousness). Gurdwaras marking his life events (e.g., Burj Baba Deep Singh at Damdama Sahib, Shahidganj at Amritsar) serve as pilgrimage sites, where devotees reflect on sacrifice and resilience.",
