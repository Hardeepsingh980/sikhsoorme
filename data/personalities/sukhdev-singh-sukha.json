      "value": "Sukhdev Singh Sukha was born on August 14, 1962 (14 Sawan, Wednesday), in Chak No. 11 FF, Sri Ganganagar District, Rajasthan, to a Saini Sikh family. His parents, Mengha Singh Banwait and Surjeet Kaur, were farmers and devout Amritdhari Sikhs. The family originally hailed from village Bhungarni in Hoshiarpur district, Punjab, and later relocated to Lyallpur (now Faisalabad, Pakistan) before settling in Rajasthan after the 1947 Partition of India. Sukha completed his early schooling in his native village and nearby Manaksar (13 FF). He earned a Bachelor of Arts (BA) from Gian Joti College, Karanpur, in 1983 and was pursuing a Master of Arts (MA) in English when Operation Blue Star occurred in June 1984. Deeply affected by the Indian Army's assault on the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and the subsequent anti-Sikh riots, he abandoned his studies and joined the Khalistan separatist movement, aligning with the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) under leaders like Labh Singh."

      "value": "As a key operative of the KCF, Sukha played a pivotal role in the armed struggle for Khalistan, an independent Sikh homeland. He participated in targeted operations against perceived perpetrators of violence against Sikhs. Notably, alongside Harjinder Singh Jinda and Ranjit Singh Gill, he assassinated Congress MP Lalit Maken on July 31, 1985, in New Delhi, citing Maken's alleged involvement in the 1984 riots (his name appeared third in the PUCL report \"Who Are The Guilty?\"). He also assassinated Congress leader Arjan Dass for similar reasons related to the riots, as documented in affidavits to the Nanavati Commission. His most prominent action was the assassination of retired General Arun Shridhar Vaidya on August 10, 1986, in Pune, who was the architect of Operation Blue Star. The KCF claimed responsibility, stating it was retaliation for the desecration of the Golden Temple. Additionally, Sukha was involved in India's largest bank robbery on February 9, 1987, at the Punjab National Bank, Miller Gunj branch, Ludhiana, where KCF militants looted approximately ‚Çπ5.7 crore (about $12.5 million USD in 2023 value) to fund the Khalistan insurgency. These actions aimed to weaken the Indian state and finance the separatist cause. [References: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki; Custom Search Results]"

He was riding the same black motorcycle used in Vaidya's assassination, which led to his identification. Harjinder Singh Jinda was arrested in March 1987 at Gurdwara Majnu-ka-Tilla in Delhi, where he was shot in the legs. During their trial, both admitted to the killings but pleaded not guilty, arguing that Vaidya and others were \"guilty of serious crimes warranting death\" under Sikh justice. On October 21, 1989, they were sentenced to death. They embraced the verdict with Sikh slogans like \"Bole So Nihal\" and \"Khalistan Zindabad.\" On October 9, 1992, Sukha and Jinda were hanged together in Yerwada Central Jail, Pune, at 6:20 AM. Their bodies were cremated near the Mula-Mutha River later that day under heavy security. [References: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]"

Operation Blue Star (June 1984) militarized the Sikh separatist struggle, leading to over 20,000 deaths in the counter-insurgency.",

    "significance": "Sukha's actions exemplified the militant phase of the Khalistan movement, drawing international attention to Sikh demands for autonomy and justice. They intensified the Punjab conflict but also led to crackdowns, contributing to the insurgency's eventual decline by the mid-1990s. His execution highlighted debates on capital punishment and minority rights in India. [References: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]"
