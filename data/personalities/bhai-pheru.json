      "value": "Bhai Pheru, originally named Sarigat, was born around 1640 in Amb Man, within the parganah of Mien ki Maur in the Lahore district (present-day Pakistan). He was the son of Bhai Binna Uppal, from the Uppal clan. As a young man, he took up peddling as a profession, traveling with his wares, which earned him the nickname \"Pheru,\" meaning peripatetic or wandering trader. During one such journey, he encountered Bhai Bhagatu, a devout Sikh, who introduced him to Guru Har Rai at Kiratpur. Deeply inspired, Bhai Pheru became a disciple and dedicated himself to selfless service in the Guru ka Langar (community kitchen), embodying the Sikh principle of seva (voluntary service). This early devotion under Guru Har Rai (1630‚Äì1661) marked the beginning of his spiritual journey."

Guru Har Rai recognized his piety and granted him \"bakhshish\" (spiritual blessing), appointing him to preach Sikh teachings and oversee langar operations in his native Nakka region. He established a center near Mien ki Maur, which became known as Bhai Pheru after him. Later, under Guru Gobind Singh, he served as treasurer and manager of the kitchen at Anandpur Sahib, ensuring efficient administration and honest handling of resources. His role highlighted the importance of organizational service in sustaining the Sikh community during turbulent times."

Bhai Pheru presented himself humbly, impressing the Guru with his spirit of service. Exempted from joining the Khalsa ranks due to his advanced age and devotion, he received honors including the epithets \"Sachchi Darhi\" (unsullied beard, symbolizing purity) and \"Sarigat Sahib\" (honored by the assembly), along with half of the Guru's own turban, which he wrapped around his monk's cap. He returned to his monastery at Bhai Pheru, where he founded a new Udasi sadhu order known as Sarigat Sahib Ke, which flourished under his guidance. Bhai Pheru passed away in 1706, leaving a legacy of spiritual preaching and communal service."
