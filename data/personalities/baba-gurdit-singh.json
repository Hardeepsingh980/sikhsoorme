      "value": "Baba Gurdit Singh was born in 1877 in Sarhali, a village in the Punjab region of British India (now in Tarn Taran district). His grandfather, Sardar Rattan Singh Dhillon, was a high-ranking officer in the Sikh Khalsa Army who fought against the British in the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845‚Äì1849) and refused a jagir (land grant) after the annexation of Punjab. His father, Sardar Hukam Singh, emigrated to British Malaya (modern-day Malaysia) as a contractor, leaving young Gurdit behind. Receiving minimal formal education due to harsh treatment by his teacher, Gurdit self-taught basic literacy by age 13 to correspond with his father. In 1885, at around age 8, he joined his father in Malaya, where he apprenticed in contracting and built a successful business in construction and trade, amassing wealth as a fisherman and entrepreneur in Singapore and surrounding areas (sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki)."

      "value": "Returning to Punjab in 1909, Gurdit Singh became an advocate for social justice. In 1911, he protested against \"begar\" (forced labor) imposed by British officials on villagers, writing formal complaints and urging locals to resist, which marked his early activism against colonial exploitation. His most significant contribution was chartering the Japanese steamship Komagata Maru in 1914 to transport 376 Indian passengers (primarily 340‚Äì351 Sikhs and 24 Muslims) from Hong Kong to Vancouver, Canada, as a direct challenge to the Canadian \"continuous journey\" regulation that effectively barred South Asian immigration. This voyage aimed to assert the rights of British Indian subjects within the Empire. The incident galvanized the Ghadar Movement, an anti-colonial revolutionary group, and exposed global racial discrimination. After the ship's forcible return to India and the violent Budge Budge clash (where 20+ passengers were killed), Gurdit evaded capture for eight years, living underground while supporting nationalist causes (cross-verified: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki, Ghadar Party historical context)."

      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Gurdit Singh's actions catalyzed reforms in immigration policies and heightened awareness of diaspora rights. The Komagata Maru incident pressured Canada to repeal the exclusionary law in 1919 (though broader restrictions persisted until 1947). In India, it fueled the independence movement, inspiring figures like those in the Ghadar Party to advocate for unity against British rule. He also promoted self-reliance among Punjabis, discouraging exploitative labor migration while fighting systemic injustices like begar (sources: Wikipedia; historical analysis from Research_For_Personality)."

He was imprisoned for five years (1922‚Äì1927) in Lahore Fort and other facilities. Post-release, he settled in Calcutta (Kolkata), continuing low-profile community service within the Sikh diaspora. He lived quietly, respected as a symbol of resistance, until his death on July 24, 1954, at age 77 (sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki; death date consistent across)."
