      "value": "Limited historical records exist on Bhai Sukha Singh's early life. He hailed from the village of Mardi Kambo ki, near Amritsar in Punjab. As a devout Sikh during a time of severe Mughal persecution under Zakariya Khan, Bhai Sukha Singh likely grew up in an environment of hiding and resistance. The Sikh community had been driven into hills and deserts following Nadir Shah's invasion in 1739, shaping young Sikhs like him into resilient warriors. No specific birth date is recorded, but his actions place him as an adult in the 1740s (citationNeeded: Exact early life details)."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhai Sukha Singh's most notable contribution was his daring mission in August 1740 to eliminate Massa Ranghar, the Mughal commander desecrating Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Disguised as revenue collectors with sacks of broken pottery, he and Bhai Mehtab Singh infiltrated the gurdwara, beheaded Ranghar while he indulged in forbidden activities, and escaped on horseback tied to the historic Ber tree (still standing today). This act restored Sikh honor and inspired resistance.  \nLater, he was entrusted with leading a Sikh jatha (detachment). In early 1746, he joined Jassa Singh Ahluwalia in raiding Eminabad (Gujranwala District), killing Jaspat Rai and triggering the Chhota Ghalughara. Badly injured, he escaped to Malwa's sandy plains with survivors. In January 1752, during Ahmed Shah Durrani's third invasion, he led a foraging expedition near Shahdara, engaging enemy troops in a fierce battle where he and his companions attained martyrdom."
