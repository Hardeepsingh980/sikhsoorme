      "value": "Bhai Roop Chand was born into a Khokharwa Rajput family that traced its ancestry to the Sidhu branch, originally settled in Tuklani (near modern-day Afghanistan influence). His grandfather Raja Sultan, father Sidhu, and family were initially followers of the Muslim pir Sakhi Server. However, a pivotal shift occurred when Sidhu's wife, Bibi Surti (daughter of Bhai Aqal, a disciple of Gurus Ram Das and Arjan Dev), influenced the family toward Sikhism. On 16th Jyeth 1670 Bikrami (circa 1613 AD), during her wedding procession, Bibi Surti met Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji and sought blessings for her husband's conversion. The Guru prophesied the birth of a son who would be honored by all. Bhai Roop Chand was born on 3rd Baisakh, and Guru Hargobind personally named him. A famous incident of devotion marked his early life: While supervising harvest, father and son offered cool water from a goat-skin container to the Guru in their hearts, abstaining despite intense heat and thirst. Guru Hargobind, aware through divine omniscience, traveled 32 miles on horseback to drink it, rewarding their faith with his robe, sword, and horse. This event occurred under a Jand tree, commemorated to this day. In 1687 Bikrami (1630 AD), Guru Hargobind founded the village of Bhai Roopa in his honor."

      "value": "In 1630 AD, Guru Hargobind honored Bhai Roop Chand with the title \"Bhai\" (brother) and appointed him as Masand for the Malwa region, marking his forehead with tilak (saffron leadership mark) and entrusting him with a karchha (long spoon) symbolizing langar service. His primary role involved collecting dasvandh (one-tenth offerings), preaching Guru Nanak's teachings, and feeding the poor and needy. He established langars across villages, including Bhai Roopa, where fresh wood miraculously burned like dry wood in the kitchen fires‚Äîa blessing from the Guru. Bhai Roop Chand expanded Sikh influence south of the Sutlej, mediating community disputes and promoting ethical living. During Guru Har Rai's 1652 visit to Daroli and Bhai Roopa, he facilitated blessings for the Phulkian family (ancestors of Patiala, Nabha, Jind rulers). He served Guru Tegh Bahadur from 1665, accompanying him on travels, and his sons Dharam Chand and Param Chand joined the Guru's entourage to Assam and Patna, aiding in diffusing enmities among local rulers."

He promoted interfaith harmony by converting his family from pir worship to Sikhism and emphasized selfless service (seva) through langar, influencing the Phulkian states' loyalty to Sikh Gurus. His efforts helped establish Sikh presence in Malwa amid Mughal pressures (citationNeeded for specific reform decrees)."

After the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur, he supported Guru Gobind Singh during crises, including post-Chamkaur recovery at Deena village, where his family returned Guru Hargobind's gifts and received a personal kirpan. His sons served until Guru Gobind Singh's time at Nanded (1708 AD). Bhai Roop Chand passed away (exact date N/A), but his samadh (memorial) is at Samadh Bhai village, where he was cremated. His seven sons‚ÄîDharam Singh, Param Singh, Karam Singh, Mahanand, Sadanand, Surtia, and Sukhia‚Äîcontinued the legacy, populating villages like Dialpura Bhai and Bagrian."
