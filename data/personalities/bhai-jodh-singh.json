      "value": "Bhai Jodh Singh was born in 1882 in Punjab, India, into a Sikh family. From childhood, he was immersed in Sikh traditions, reciting daily prayers like Japji Sahib and Sukhmani Sahib, inspired by his grandfather. His early education fostered a deep devotion to Gurbani, leading him to study Sikh scriptures extensively. He pursued higher education in Punjab, developing a profound understanding of Gurmat (Sikh philosophy). As a young man, he joined the Singh Sabha movement, which aimed to reform and revive Sikh identity amid colonial influences. In 1903, at age 21, he led the establishment of The Khalsa Advocate, an English newspaper to propagate Sikh teachings and counter missionary activities (Wikipedia; SikhiWiki)."
