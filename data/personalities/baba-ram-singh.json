      "value": "After the decline of the Sikh Empire following Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death, Satguru Ram Singh became concerned about growing British influence and the spiritual decline within the Sikh community. He galvanized followers, primarily from humble backgrounds, to establish a 'Sant Khalsa' aimed at restoring Sikh prestige and values. He is credited with pioneering the use of non-cooperation and boycott of British goods and services as a political instrument, predating Mahatma Gandhi's similar movements."

He administered 'Khande di Pahul' (Amrit Sanchar) to five Sikhs, leading to a large number of baptisms within ten years, as noted in British Archives and Giani Gian Singh's 'Panth Parkash.' His followers, known as Namdhari Sikhs, were also called Kukas due to their spiritually ecstatic behavior during religious gatherings. He emphasized a return to the pure teachings of the Gurus, combating moral degeneration like drinking, opium consumption, and other vices prevalent at the time. Sardar Kapur Singh noted that Baba Ram Singh preached the same path and principles as Guru Nanak and Guru Gobind Singh."
