      "value": "Bhatt Kirat was born into a prominent Gaur Brahmin family of the Kaushish gotra in Sultanpur Lodhi, Punjab. He was the son of Bhatt Bhika and the brother of fellow poet Bhatt Mathura. His family's ancestral roots trace back to Ladwa village near Kurukshetra in present-day Haryana, where his forebears had settled before migrating to Punjab. As a learned Brahmin, Kirat received traditional education in Sanskrit, poetry, and bardic traditions, earning the honorific \"Bhatt,\" reserved for scholarly Brahmin poets. Growing up in a region influenced by the rising Bhakti movement and the early Sikh Gurus, Kirat was drawn to the spiritual and literary milieu of the time, eventually serving in the court of Guru Arjan Dev."

      "value": "Kirat's primary service was as a court poet in Guru Arjan Dev's darbar, where he composed poetic eulogies praising the Sikh Gurus. His eight savaiye, poetic verses in the savaiya meter, are included in the Guru Granth Sahib under the section Bhatt Bani (pages 1389‚Äì1409). These hymns eulogize Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, and Guru Arjan, portraying them as divine lights in a lineage of spiritual enlightenment. Bhatt Kirat's work contributed to the compilation of the Adi Granth (the original version of the Guru Granth Sahib) in 1604, enriching Sikh scripture with bardic praise that reinforced the Gurus' authority and teachings. His poetry reflects the cultural synthesis of Brahminical traditions with Sikh egalitarianism, serving as a bridge between Hindu poetic forms and emerging Sikh literature."

These verses are structured under \"Savaiye Mahalle Panjve Ke\" (Eulogies of the Fifth Master) and earlier sections. They employ classical Sanskrit-influenced Punjabi, using metaphors of light (jyot) and sovereignty to describe the Gurus' divine mission. No independent writings outside the Granth are recorded, as his legacy is preserved within Sikh scripture."

Some unverified sources suggest involvement in Sikh resistance against Mughal oppression under Guru Hargobind, including the Battle of Amritsar (citationNeeded; historical records indicate the battle occurred in 1621, and the mentioned 1634 conflict with Murtza Khan may refer to a separate event or figure). No confirmed date or circumstances of death are available, but he is remembered primarily as a devotional poet rather than a warrior."
