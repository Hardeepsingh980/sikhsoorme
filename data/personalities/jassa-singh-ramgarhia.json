      "value": "Jassa Singh was born in 1723 into a Sikh Tarkhan (carpenter) family in Ichogil village, near Lahore. His grandfather, Hardas Singh, was a devoted Sikh who received Amrit from Guru Gobind Singh and served under Banda Singh Bahadur, participating in early Sikh resistance against Mughal forces. Hardas Singh died in a skirmish in 1716. Jassa Singh's father, Giani Bhagwan Singh, was a skilled soldier who joined Mughal forces under Khan Bahadur but died heroically saving the Lahore governor during Nadir Shah's 1739 invasion. Bhagwan Singh received villages like Valla as rewards, which Jassa Singh inherited. After his father's death in 1739, Jassa Singh, along with his brothers, joined the Sikh community in Amritsar. He initially worked under Adina Beg, the Faujdar of Jalandhar Doab, rising to Risaldar (cavalry commander). By the 1740s, he was actively involved in Sikh defenses, earning the name \"Ramgarhia\" after fortifying Ram Rauni into Ramgarh in 1752. [Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]"

      "value": "Jassa Singh's primary contributions were military, leading the Ramgarhia Misl in numerous campaigns to protect Sikh territories and civilians. He rebuilt and defended Ram Rauni (renamed Ramgarh) multiple times against Mughal sieges, symbolizing Sikh resilience. In 1758, after Adina Beg's death, he captured Sri Hargobindpur, establishing it as his headquarters. He collaborated with other Misls in the Dal Khalsa, participating in the Wadda Ghalughara (Great Holocaust) survival and counterattacks against Ahmad Shah Abdali's invasions (e.g., sacking Kasur in 1763). He provided Rakhi (protection tax) services to villages, ensuring safety from invaders. Later, he allied with Patiala forces to expand influence toward Delhi, capturing territories in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh in the 1780s. His leadership helped consolidate Sikh power in Majha and Doaba regions. [SikhiWiki; Research_For_Personality]"

He regained influence by allying with Ranjit Singh's Sukerchakia Misl and participated in the 1783 Delhi campaign, where Sikhs briefly occupied the Red Fort and he symbolically \"captured\" the Mughal throne, transporting it to Amritsar. By 1799, he reluctantly accepted Ranjit Singh's leadership after Lahore's capture. He died in 1803 at age 80 in Sri Hargobindpur (Gurdaspur district), succeeded by his son Jodh Singh, who maintained peace with Ranjit Singh. [SikhiWiki; Wikipedia]"
