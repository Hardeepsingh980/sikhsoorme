      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Sain was born around Vikram Samvat 1400 (c. 1343 CE) in Sohal village, near Amritsar, Punjab, to parents Mukand Rai and Mata Jivani. Alternative traditions place his birth in Rewa (Madhya Pradesh), Maharashtra, or Rajasthan, but the Punjab origin is most widely accepted among Sikh sources, with a Gurdwara and sarovar commemorating the site in Partabpura, Punjab. From a young age, Sain showed disinterest in formal studies and was sent to Lahore to learn the barber's trade under Ustad Azeem. He married Bibi Sahib Devi and had a son, Baba Nayi. Influenced by the prevailing Bhakti movement, he immersed himself in devotional hymns and sought spiritual guidance, eventually becoming a disciple of Bhagat Ramanand. His early life reflected the socio-religious fervor of the era, where devotion transcended caste barriers‚ÄîSain, from the Nai (barber) caste, rose through piety despite societal hierarchies.

      "value": "As a court barber to Raja Ram Singh of Rewa (Bandhavgarh), Sain's duties included grooming, matchmaking, and entertaining with songs and tales. However, his true service was to saints and God; he performed menial tasks for holy men, viewing it as divine worship. A pivotal legend recounts how, upon encountering sadhus en route to the palace, Sain prioritized serving them with food and kirtan, delaying his royal duties. Miraculously, God assumed Sain's form to attend the king, averting punishment and converting Raja Ram to discipleship. This event established a tradition where Bandhavgarh kings became followers of Sain's lineage (later linked to Kabir). Sain traveled across India, promoting Ram Naam (God's name) and challenging caste discrimination, initiating disciples from all backgrounds, including Brahmin Kordass. His life embodied Bhakti ideals of equality and devotion. (Sources: Bhagat Mal by Nabha Das, Bhai Gurdas; cross-verified with Wikipedia summary)"

      "value": "- Abolition of caste system: As a low-caste barber, Sain demonstrated that spiritual merit surpasses social hierarchy, influencing anti-caste sentiments in Bhakti and Sikh traditions.  - Promotion of selfless service (Seva): Prioritizing saints over worldly obligations became a model for Sikh ethics.  - Devotional equality: His acceptance as Ramanand's disciple despite caste broke barriers, inspiring similar reforms by contemporaries like Kabir and Ravidas.  No formal institutional reforms, but his bani and legends contributed to broader Bhakti-Sikh syncretism.

This pauri extols worship through incense, lamps, and ghee, hailing God as the source of supreme joy and the savior from worldly fears. Themes include gratitude to the divine, the role of the Guru (Ramanand) in attaining God, and the all-pervading nature of Ram. Additional Marathi devotional songs are attributed to him in some traditions, supporting Maharashtra birth theories. His janamsakhi, \"Sri Sain Granth,\" chronicles his life. No other verified writings; his influence lies in oral traditions and the single Gurbani inclusion, affirming his sanctity in Sikhism. (Sources: Guru Granth Sahib; SikhiWiki)"

Sain passed away there around Vikram Samvat 1490 (c. 1433 CE), instructing his son to return home after a year, acknowledging worldly ties. His death marked the end of an era of Bhakti saints whose works would later integrate into Sikh scriptures. A Dehra (shrine) in Partabpura, Jalandhar, honors his meditation site.
