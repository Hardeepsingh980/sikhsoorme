      "value": "Giani Sant Singh Maskeen was born in 1934 in Lakki Marwat, a village in the Bannu District of the North-West Frontier Province (present-day Pakistan), to Sardar Kartar Singh and Mata Ram Kaur. As the only son in his family, he received primary education at Khalsa School and later attended Government High School. However, the Partition of India in 1947 profoundly disrupted his life. At around age 13, his family fled the violence and migrated to Alwar, Rajasthan, India, along with millions of other Sikhs and Hindus. The trauma of Partition, including communal riots and displacement, left a lasting impact. In Alwar, language barriers (his prior education was in Urdu and Persian) prevented him from continuing formal studies. Facing financial hardships after his father's death in 1952, he briefly worked in a factory for three months. Feeling isolated, he left home to immerse himself in spiritual pursuits, studying Gurbani under various scholars and saints, which ignited his lifelong passion for Sikh teachings (Sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki)."
