      "value": "Bhai Satta was born into a Muslim Doom-Mirasi family, a hereditary caste of minstrels, drummers, and genealogists in the Punjab region during the late 15th or early 16th century. Little is known about his exact birth date or place, but historical accounts place his active life in the late 16th to early 17th century. As a mirasi, music was his profession, and he began his service to the Sikh Gurus during the guruship of Guru Angad Dev (r. 1539‚Äì1552), shortly after Guru Nanak's passing. Some sources describe him primarily as a drummer playing the jori (a pair of drums), while others note him as a rababi, similar to his brother Rai Balwand, who played the rabab (a plucked string instrument). Together, they formed a musical duo that performed kirtan (devotional singing) in the Gurus' darbars (courts), continuing this service through the times of Guru Amar Das (r. 1552‚Äì1574), Guru Ram Das (r. 1574‚Äì1581), and Guru Arjan Dev (r. 1581‚Äì1606). Their music was integral to the early institutionalization of Sikh musical traditions, drawing from dhrupad and other North Indian classical forms prevalent in the Mughal era (citation: Wikipedia - Satta Doom; SikhiWiki - Bhai Satta)."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",

      "value": "Bhai Satta's primary contributions were in the realm of Sikh music and devotion. As a rababi or drummer, he accompanied the singing of Gurbani (Sikh scriptures) in the Gurus' courts, helping to establish the rababi tradition that continues today. He served four consecutive Gurus, performing sabad kirtan (hymn singing) and promoting the Guru's teachings through melody. His most notable service came under Guru Arjan, during whose tenure the Adi Granth (predecessor to the Guru Granth Sahib) was compiled. Satta's music helped preserve and propagate Sikh compositions, emphasizing themes of devotion, equality, and the divine light passing from Guru Nanak to successors. After a period of absence from service‚Äîdue to family obligations or arrogance, as per traditional accounts‚Äîhe returned humbled and contributed original hymns as penance, which were included in the sacred scripture (citation: SikhiWiki - Satta and Balwand; Bhai Vir Singh, *Sant Gur Chamatkar*, 1952)."

This var (heroic ode) consists of eight stanzas praising the first five Sikh Gurus, highlighting the unbroken chain of Guruship and their spiritual qualities. It is found on pages 966‚Äì968 of the Guru Granth Sahib under the heading \"Ramkali ki Vaar, Rai Balvand te Satta Doom ki.\" The composition uses the Ramkali raga, a morning raga associated with heroism and devotion, and serves as a poetic genealogy of the Gurus. No other independent writings by Satta are recorded, but his verses emphasize humility, divine grace, and the rejection of ego (citation: Guru Granth Sahib; Sarup Das Bhalla, *Mahima Prakash*, 1971)."

Traditional narratives describe a miraculous event during Guru Arjan's time: after Satta and Balwand ceased performing due to family disputes, Guru Arjan's horse refused to move until they returned, leading to their forgiveness and recommitment. They likely passed away in the early 17th century, continuing their service until Guru Arjan's martyrdom in 1606. No specific death records exist (citation: Bhai Santokh Singh, *Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth*, 1927‚Äì35; \"citationNeeded\" for exact final years)."
