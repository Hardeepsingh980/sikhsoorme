      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Farid was born into a scholarly Muslim family in Kothewal, a village near Multan in the Punjab region (then part of the Delhi Sultanate). His father, Jamal-ud-din Suleiman, was a physician and religious scholar, and his mother, Maryam Bibi (daughter of Wajih-ud-din Khojendi), was known for her piety. The family had migrated from Kabul, Afghanistan, during the time of Farid's grandfather, fleeing Mongol invasions led by Halaku (grandson of Genghis Khan) around 1125 CE [Reference: SikhiWiki, Jawahir-i-Faridi].  \n\nFrom childhood, Farid displayed deep devotion. A popular legend recounts how his mother rewarded his prayers with hidden sugar crystals under his prayer mat, earning him the epithet \"Shakar Ganj\" (Treasury of Sugar) after a miraculous abundance appeared during her absence [Reference: Macauliffe, The Sikh Religion]. He received early education in Multan, a hub of Islamic learning, where he memorized the Quran and studied Persian and Arabic. At around age 12‚Äì16, he performed Hajj and, upon return, sought advanced spiritual guidance. In Multan, he met his guru, Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki (a Chishti Sufi from Baghdad en route to Delhi), who became his lifelong mentor. Farid moved to Delhi for further studies under Kaki, living ascetically and focusing on Islamic doctrine, mysticism, and poetry [Reference: Wikipedia, Farid al-Din Ganjshakar]."

    {
      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Farid's primary contributions were in spiritual preaching, poetry, and establishing Sufi centers that promoted interfaith harmony. As a disciple of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, he succeeded him spiritually after Kaki's death in 1235 CE, becoming a key figure in the Chishti order‚Äîone of India's earliest Sufi silsilas (lineages). He settled in Ajodhan (modern Pakpattan) around 1236 CE, transforming it into a hub for dervishes and pilgrims. There, he emphasized selfless service (seva), charity (langar distribution), and devotion to Allah through love and humility [Reference: SikhiWiki].  \n\nHis poetry, written in simple Punjabi, addressed the common people, making profound Sufi concepts accessible. Farid rejected worldly wealth, distributing royal gifts to the poor, and attracted diverse followers, including Hindus and low-caste Muslims. Legends highlight his role in converting thieves and resolving disputes through miracles, fostering social unity amid feudal oppression [Reference: Nizam-ud-Din Auliya's accounts]. In Sikh tradition, his inclusion in the Guru Granth Sahib underscores his universal message of oneness with the Divine."

    {
      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Farid advocated for inner spirituality over ritualism, challenging orthodox Islamic practices by promoting music (sama) and poetry for divine ecstasy‚Äîthough he debated its lawfulness in teachings. He reformed Sufi discipleship by emphasizing ethical living, contentment, and non-violence, influencing the Chishti emphasis on humility and service to humanity. Socially, he bridged religious divides in a era of Hindu-Muslim tensions, teaching that the Divine resides in all hearts. His rejection of courtly favors under Sultan Balban promoted detachment from power [Reference: SikhiWiki quotes; Wikipedia]. Scholars note his role in elevating Punjabi as a literary medium, predating Hindi devotional works [citationNeeded: Exact influence on later Bhakti movement]."

      "label": "Compositions/Writings",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Farid is credited as the first major Punjabi poet, with over 4,000 slokas (couplets) attributed to him in Sufi texts like the Jawahir-i-Faridi. However, only 134 shlokas appear in the Guru Granth Sahib (pages 488, 794, 957‚Äì966, 1377‚Äì1384), composed in Punjabi using the Lahndi dialect. These focus on mortality, divine love, and ethical conduct. Debate exists on authorship: some attribute them to Farid Shakar Ganj (d. 1265), others to his successor Farid Sani (Sheikh Brahm, d. 1552), whom Guru Nanak met [Reference: Macauliffe; SikhiWiki]. Examples include themes of restraining desires (\"like a bird\") and beholding God within. His full divan (collection) survives in oral traditions and manuscripts at Pakpattan [Reference: Wikipedia]."

      "value": "In his later years, Farid lived reclusively in Pakpattan, mentoring disciples like Nizam-ud-Din Auliya and performing alleged miracles, such as summoning rain during droughts. He married Sultan Balban's daughter Hazabra but lived ascetically, donating her dowry to charity. Farid endured imprisonment briefly under Balban for refusing royal service but was released. He passed away from pneumonia on the 5th of Muharram, 1266 CE (or 1265 per some sources), and was buried in Pakpattan. His mausoleum became a pilgrimage site, with his spiritual successor line continuing through nine generations [Reference: SikhiWiki; Kaulasat-ul-Tawarikh]."

  "spiritualLegacy": {
    "description": "Bhagat Farid's legacy lies in his synthesis of Sufi mysticism with universal ethics, portraying God as a loving Beloved accessible through inner purity. His shlokas in the Guru Granth Sahib affirm Sikh principles like Naam Simran (meditation on the Divine Name) and rejection of ego, making him a bridge between Islam and Sikhism. Revered as a pir (spiritual guide) by Muslims and Bhagat by Sikhs, his teachings emphasize tolerance and devotion amid religious strife.",
