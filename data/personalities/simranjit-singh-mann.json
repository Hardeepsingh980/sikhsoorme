He also served as Aide-de-Camp to the Governor of Punjab. His career was marked by efficient service in law enforcement during a turbulent period in Punjab. In 1984, he resigned from the IPS on June 18 in protest against Operation Blue Star, the Indian Army's assault on the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), viewing it as an attack on Sikh sovereignty. Following his resignation, he became a vocal advocate for Sikh rights, founding and leading the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) to promote a \"buffer state\" for regional aspirations, often referred to as Khalistan. He has been involved in peaceful struggles for social justice, ethnic and religious minority rights, and against state repression."
