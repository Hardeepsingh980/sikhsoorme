      "value": "Bhai Lehna was born on March 31, 1504, in Matte Di Sarai, a village in the Punjab region during the early Mughal era under Babur's invasions. His father, Pheru Mal, was a small-scale trader from the Khatri caste (Trehan gotra), and his mother was Mata Ramo (also known as Mata Sabhrai or Daya Kaur). The family fled their ancestral home due to invasions and resettled in Khadur Sahib near the Beas River. As a young man, Lehna was a devoted Hindu, leading pilgrimages to the Jawalamukhi Temple and serving as a priest of Goddess Durga. At age 16 (around 1520), he married Mata Khivi, with whom he had two sons (Datu and Dasu) and two daughters (Amro and Anokhi). His life changed profoundly in his late 20s when he heard Guru Nanak's hymns from Bhai Jodha during a pilgrimage. Drawn by their spiritual depth, Lehna visited Kartarpur, met Guru Nanak, and became his disciple. For six to seven years, he renounced his previous faith, served selflessly (e.g., washing a muddy jug when Nanak's sons refused), and immersed himself in Sikh teachings, embodying humility and devotion [citation: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]."

      "value": "As Guru from 1539, Angad (renamed by Nanak, meaning \"my own limb\") shifted the Sikh center to Khadur Sahib. He expanded Langar (community kitchen), personally twisting grass ropes for a living to model honest labor and reject parasitism. He established Mall Akharas (wrestling arenas) to promote physical fitness alongside spiritual growth, open to all castes. Angad traveled widely, founding Dharamsalas (Sikh centers) and encouraging education. He collected and preserved Guru Nanak's hymns, compiling an early biography (Bhai Bala Janamsakhi prototype). His service emphasized nishkam sewa (selfless service), aiding the needy and fostering a casteless community during a time of social upheaval [citation: SikhiWiki; Wikipedia]."

      "value": "- **Gurmukhi Script:** Modified the Landa script into Gurmukhi around 1541, making it phonetic and accessible, dissociating Sikhs from Sanskrit's elitism and enabling mass literacy in Punjabi. This preserved Sikh scriptures' purity and empowered lower castes [citation: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki].  - **Social Equality:** Integrated women into Sangat (congregation) and Langar, with Mata Khivi leading kitchen efforts. Abolished caste barriers in worship and meals [citation: SikhiWiki].  - **Education and Health:** Opened schools for children and promoted sports, countering superstition and promoting holistic development [citation: Research_For_Personality].  - **Institution Building:** Strengthened Udasis (though later distinct) and resisted external influences like yogis, solidifying Sikh identity [citation: Wikipedia]."

Around 1551‚Äì1552, he began developing Goindwal and blessed Mughal emperor Humayun during his exile. Guru Angad left his physical form on March 29, 1552, at age 48, entrusting scriptures to Amar Das [citation: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]."
