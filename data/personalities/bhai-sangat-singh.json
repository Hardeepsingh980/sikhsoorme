He was a devoted Sikh who joined the ranks of Guru Gobind Singh Ji's followers during a period of intense Mughal oppression in Punjab. His upbringing likely occurred in the Punjab region amid the socio-political turmoil of the late 17th century, where Sikhism was emerging as a force against tyranny. As a warrior, he received training in martial arts, archery, and swordsmanship, common for Khalsa Sikhs initiated after 1699.

After the Sikhs' evacuation from Anandpur Sahib and crossing the Sarsa River, Guru Gobind Singh Ji and about 40 Sikhs, including his sons, sought refuge in a haveli (fort-like house) in Chamkaur. Surrounded by a massive Mughal and hill raja coalition (estimated 10,000+ troops), the Sikhs faced overwhelming odds. As casualties mounted, the remaining Panj Pyare (Five Beloved) ordered Guru Ji to escape to preserve the Sikh flame. Bhai Sangat Singh, due to his striking physical resemblance to the Guru, donned his attire, turban, and plume (kalgi) to deceive the enemy. Accompanied by Bhai Sant Singh, he stayed behind to fight. The next morning, they engaged the Mughal forces in hand-to-hand combat and attained martyrdom, ensuring Guru Ji's safe departure."
