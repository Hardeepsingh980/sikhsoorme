      "value": "Bhai Lal Chand was originally a halwai, or sweet maker, leading a civilian life before joining the Sikh fold. He was profoundly inspired by the heroic exploits of Mahant Kirpal Das, a sadhu-warrior associated with the Guru's court. Lacking any formal military training, Bhai Lal Chand's devotion led him to enlist in Guru Gobind Singh Ji's army. He was equipped with basic armaments—a horse, sword, and shield—marking his transition from an ordinary artisan to a soldier of faith. This reflects the inclusive ethos of Sikhism during the late 17th century, where devotion transcended social or professional backgrounds."
