      "value": "Udham Singh was born Sher Singh on December 26, 1899, in Pilbad, Sunam, in the Sangrur district of Punjab, British India, to a Kamboj farming family. His father, Tehal Singh (also known as Chuhar Singh), worked as a railway crossing watchman. He lost his mother in 1901 and his father in 1907. Orphaned at a young age, Sher Singh and his elder brother, Sadhu Singh (originally Mukta Singh), were admitted to the Central Khalsa Orphanage in Amritsar on October 24, 1907. There, they underwent Sikh initiatory rites, and Sher Singh was renamed Udham Singh. His brother Sadhu Singh passed away in 1917. Udham Singh received training in various arts and crafts at the orphanage, passed his matriculation examination in 1918, and left in 1919. Despite his young age, he briefly served in the British Indian Army during World War I, attached to the 32nd Sikh Pioneers, and later rejoined for carpentry and maintenance work in Basra and Baghdad before returning to Amritsar in early 1919."

      "value": "Udham Singh's primary contribution was his unwavering commitment to avenging the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and his broader fight against British colonial rule. He actively participated in revolutionary movements, joining the Ghadar Party in 1924, where he worked to organize overseas Indians against British imperialism. His assassination of Sir Michael O'Dwyer served as a symbolic act of defiance and retribution, galvanizing nationalist sentiments across India and drawing international attention to the atrocities committed under British rule. His adoption of the name Ram Mohammad Singh Azad was a powerful statement of secularism and unity in the independence struggle."

      "value": "After his release from prison in 1931, Udham Singh continued his revolutionary activities in Punjab, eventually escaping to Germany in 1933 and then to London in 1934. He meticulously planned his revenge against Sir Michael O'Dwyer for nearly 21 years. On March 13, 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, he successfully assassinated O'Dwyer and injured several other British officials. He made no attempt to escape and was arrested on the spot. During his trial, he famously used the name Ram Mohammad Singh Azad. Despite appeals for clemency, he was sentenced to death and subsequently hanged on July 31, 1940, at Pentonville Prison. His body was buried within the prison grounds."
