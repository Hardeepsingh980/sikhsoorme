      "value": "Bhai Taru Singh's final years were marked by his unwavering stand against Mughal tyranny. He was arrested on charges of treason after an informant (Aqil Das or a mahant, as per different sources) reported his activities to Zakaria Khan. Despite his sister's freedom being secured through a bribe by villagers, Bhai Taru Singh staunchly refused any pardon or compromise on his faith. He endured imprisonment and torture. When brought before Zakaria Khan, he attributed his strength and resilience to his uncut hair (keshas), blessed by Guru Gobind Singh. Enraged, Zakaria Khan ordered his hair to be cut, but when the barber attempted, it reportedly became as strong as iron. Consequently, the emperor commanded that his scalp be removed. Bhai Taru Singh endured this horrific ordeal, famously stating that he rejoiced his hair remained intact. According to Sikh tradition, he cursed Zakaria Khan, predicting his death by his shoes. Khan was subsequently afflicted with unbearable pain and a severe medical condition. Following the advice to hit himself with Bhai Taru Singh's shoes, his condition temporarily improved, but he died 22 days later, fulfilling Bhai Taru Singh's prophecy. Upon hearing of Khan's death, Bhai Taru Singh consciously left his body on July 1, 1745."
