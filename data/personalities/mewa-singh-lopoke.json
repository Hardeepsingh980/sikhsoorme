He came into contact with Sikh community leaders like Bhag Singh Bhikhiwind and Balwant Singh Khurdpur of the Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver. He played a significant role in the fundraising and construction of the first Gurdwara (Sikh temple) in Vancouver and North America, which was inaugurated in January 1908. After its opening, Mewa Singh was initiated as a Khalsa Sikh and actively participated in the Gurdwara's upkeep, also serving as a granthi, or scripture reader. He later became a member of the Ghadar Party, a movement founded in April 1913 by Indians in North America with the aim of achieving India's independence from British rule."

      "value": "Mewa Singh's involvement with the Ghadar Party deepened as he became aware of the surveillance efforts by Canadian immigration officials against Indian nationalists. W.C. Hopkinson, an immigration inspector, was at the center of this effort, employing informants within the Punjabi community. On October 21, 1914, Mewa Singh assassinated W.C. Hopkinson. This act of political violence led to his arrest, trial, and subsequent execution by the Canadian government on January 11, 1915. In the eyes of Sikh Canadians, Mewa Singh's sacrifice is commemorated annually as a display of martyrdom."
