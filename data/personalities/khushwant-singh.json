      "value": "Khushwant Singh was born on February 2, 1915, in Hadali (now in Pakistan) to a prominent Sikh family. His father, Sir Sobha Singh, was a successful contractor who built key structures in Lutyens' Delhi, amassing significant wealth. His mother was Varyam Kaur (Lady Sobha Singh). As the younger son, Singh grew up in privilege but faced ridicule at Modern School in New Delhi due to his birth name, Khushal Singh, which he later changed to Khushwant to match his brother Bhagwant's name. He excelled in Urdu but struggled with arithmetic. After intermediate studies at St. Stephen's College, Delhi (1930‚Äì1932), he earned a BA from Government College, Lahore (1934). Pursuing law, he studied at King's College London and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1938. The Partition of India in 1947 disrupted his early legal practice in Lahore, forcing his family to relocate to Delhi."

He edited *New Delhi* and *Hindustan Times* (1980‚Äì1983). As a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha (1980‚Äì1986), he advocated for secularism and minority rights. His diplomatic and media roles amplified Sikh voices globally, especially post-1984 Operation Blue Star, when he returned his Padma Bhushan in protest.
