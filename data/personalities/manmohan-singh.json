      "value": "Manmohan Singh was born on 26 September 1932 in Gah, a village in the Punjab Province of British India (now Pakistan), into a Punjabi Sikh family of Khatri background. His father, Gurmukh Singh Kohli, was a trader in dry fruits, and his mother, Amrit Kaur, passed away when he was young. Raised by his paternal grandmother, Jamna Devi, Singh endured hardships, including studying by candlelight due to lack of electricity in his village. He began his education at a local gurdwara, learning Urdu and Punjabi, before attending government schools in Gah and Peshawar. The Partition of India in 1947 forced his family to migrate to Amritsar, India, where they faced refugee challenges. Singh excelled academically, completing his matriculation in 1948. He pursued higher education at Panjab University (then in Hoshiarpur), earning a BA (Hons) in Economics in 1952 and an MA in 1954, topping his class. He then studied at St. John's College, Cambridge, receiving a BA (Hons) in Economics in 1957 with the Wright's Prize. Singh completed his DPhil at Nuffield College, Oxford, in 1962, with a thesis on India's export performance (1951‚Äì1960). His early life was marked by resilience, intellectual pursuit, and adaptation to post-Partition upheaval. [Source: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]"

Key roles included Chief Economic Advisor (1972‚Äì1976), Secretary of Finance (1976‚Äì1980), Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (1982‚Äì1985), and Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission (1985‚Äì1987). As Finance Minister under P.V. Narasimha Rao (1991‚Äì1996), he dismantled the License Raj, liberalized trade, and integrated India into the global economy amid a balance-of-payments crisis‚Äîreforms credited with averting economic collapse and fostering growth. Entering politics, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1991, serving as Leader of the Opposition (1998‚Äì2004). As Prime Minister (2004‚Äì2014), under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), he oversaw initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Right to Information Act (2005), National Rural Health Mission, and the Indo-US Civil Nuclear Agreement (2008). His tenure saw GDP growth averaging 7‚Äì8% annually, poverty reduction, and India's emergence as a BRICS founder.
