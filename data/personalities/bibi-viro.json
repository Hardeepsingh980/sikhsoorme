      "value": "Bibi Viro was born on 11 July 1615 in Amritsar, Punjab, to Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, and his wife Mata Damodari. As the only daughter among Guru Hargobind's children from this union, she grew up in the heart of the Sikh community during a transformative period. Guru Hargobind, who assumed guruship at age 11 following the martyrdom of his father Guru Arjan in 1606, introduced the concept of *miri-piri* (temporal and spiritual authority), militarizing the Sikh faith in response to Mughal persecution. Bibi Viro was raised in this environment of spiritual discipline and martial preparedness, immersed in Sikh teachings, horsemanship, and community service at the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex. Her upbringing under her father's guidance, who wore two swords symbolizing dual authority, instilled in her a deep sense of devotion and resilience. Historical accounts note that Guru Hargobind had one daughter, Bibi Viro, and five sons: Baba Gurditta, Suraj Mal, Ani Rai, Atal Rai, and Tegh Bahadur (later the ninth Guru).

      "value": "While direct personal contributions are sparsely documented, Bibi Viro's role in Sikh history is tied to her familial support during Guru Hargobind's era of resistance against Mughal oppression. She exemplified Sikh values of *seva* (selfless service) and family unity. Her life aligned with the community's efforts to establish langars (community kitchens) and protective militias. Notably, her sons' participation in battles reflects the martial ethos she likely nurtured, continuing her father's legacy of defending the faith. Bibi Viro's spiritual influence is inferred from her position in the Guru's household, where she would have participated in religious discourses and gurdwara activities.

Her sons' involvement in the 1688 Battle of Bhangani suggests she lived into at least the late 17th century, witnessing the continuity of Sikh resistance under subsequent Gurus.
