He is believed to have been born in the late 16th century in the Punjab region, possibly in a village near Amritsar or Sri Hargobindpur (citationNeeded). As a young Sikh, he was drawn to the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and developed skills in music and singing, which were central to Sikh worship. His devotion led him to join the sangat (congregation) of Guru Hargobind around the early 1620s, during the Guru's establishment of the Akal Takht and the shift towards miri-piri (temporal and spiritual authority)."

      "value": "Bhai Mahri served as a prominent ragi in Guru Hargobind's darbar at Sri Hargobindpur and later at Amritsar. His primary contribution was through kirtan, where he sang shabads (hymns) from the Guru Granth Sahib to inspire the Sikh community. During a period of intense persecution by Mughal forces, his music provided spiritual solace and boosted morale among the Nihang warriors and devotees. He is noted for his loyalty, accompanying the Guru during akharas (martial training sessions) and battles, using his voice to recite banis (scriptures) that emphasized courage and faith. Historical accounts suggest he participated in the Guru's court rituals, contributing to the cultural preservation of Sikh music traditions (SikhiWiki references to similar figures; citationNeeded for specific events)."
