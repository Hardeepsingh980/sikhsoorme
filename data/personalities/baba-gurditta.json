      "value": "Baba Gurditta was born on November 5, 1613 (or October 13, 1608, per some sources like Bhatt Vahis), in the forested village of Daroli Bhai in Punjab's Malwa region, to Guru Hargobind and Mata Damodari. His birth was celebrated with the distribution of sacred prasad, and contemporary records note it as an auspicious event. From a young age, he exhibited qualities reminiscent of Guru Nanak, earning him the name \"Gurditta\" (meaning \"Guru-given form\"). Trained in religious lore, martial arts, and Sikh principles under his father's guidance, Gurditta was engaged at age six in 1619 to Ananti (later Mata Nihal Kaur), daughter of Bhai Rama from Batala. Their marriage on April 17, 1621, was a grand affair, with Guru Hargobind gifting him a horse valued at 100,000 rupees. During 1626‚Äì1627, he resided in Kartarpur (Jalandhar district) on his father's directive, honing leadership skills amid rising Mughal hostilities."

      "value": "Following commands from Guru Hargobind, Baba Gurditta founded the township of Kiratpur Sahib around 1630 in the Shivalik foothills, which became a key Sikh center for spiritual and martial training. Appointed by the aging Baba Sri Chand (Guru Nanak's son) as successor to lead the Udasi sect circa 1629, he invigorated its missionary work by establishing four preaching centers (dh≈´ƒÅ·πÖs). These efforts expanded Udasi outreach, blending asceticism with Sikh teachings to propagate across Punjab and beyond. He also commanded Sikh forces in the Battle of Kartarpur (1635) against Mughal-backed Painda Khan, where he slew his childhood friend Asman Khan in combat, demonstrating valor while mourning the loss."

      "value": "In his later years, Baba Gurditta balanced spiritual duties with military involvement. Post the 1635 battle, he rested under a sacred banyan tree in Kartarpur (still revered today). On March 15, 1638, during a hunt near Kiratpur, he reluctantly performed a miracle by reviving a cow mistaken for a deer, drawing admonishment from Guru Hargobind for defying Sikh emphasis on natural humility. Deeply remorseful, he secluded himself outside Kiratpur near Pir Budhan Shah's shrine and passed away the same day at age 24. His death profoundly affected the Sikh community, with Guru Hargobind mourning deeply. An alternate tradition links his passing to a rejected marriage proposal, but primary accounts emphasize spiritual introspection."
