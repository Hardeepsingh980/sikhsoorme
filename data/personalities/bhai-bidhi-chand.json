      "value": "Bhai Bidhi Chand was born into a Jat Sikh family of the Chhina clan in the village of Chhina, approximately 35 km south of Amritsar, Punjab. His father was Bhai Vassan (possibly Hindal, a follower of Guru Amar Das), and his mother hailed from the nearby village of Sirhali. As a young man in Sur Singh village (Lahore district), Bidhi Chand fell into bad company and became a notorious bandit. His life changed dramatically when Bhai Adali, a pious Sikh from Chohia village, introduced him to Guru Arjan Dev. In the Guru's presence, Bidhi Chand experienced a profound spiritual transformation, renouncing his criminal ways and dedicating himself to Sikh service. He became a close devotee of Guru Arjan, marking the beginning of his journey as a gursikh."

      "value": "Bidhi Chand's service to the Sikh Gurus was multifaceted, encompassing military valor, loyalty, and preaching. He was one of the five trusted Sikhs selected to accompany Guru Arjan on his fateful journey to Lahore for martyrdom in 1606, witnessing the Guru's torture and execution under Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Under Guru Hargobind, the sixth Guru, Bidhi Chand rose to prominence as a key military figure. Following Guru Arjan's martyrdom, Guru Hargobind militarized the Sikh community to defend against escalating threats. Bidhi Chand was appointed as one of the first commanders of the Risaldari (cavalry) and the Akal Sena, the inaugural standing Sikh army. He led cavalry charges in several battles against Mughal forces, displaying exceptional bravery. Notably, Guru Hargobind blessed him with the epithet \"Bidhi Chand Chhina Guru Ka Seena,\" signifying his role as the \"chest\" (protector and close confidant) of the Guru. Later, from Kiratpur, he was dispatched on a preaching mission to the eastern provinces, where he converted the Muslim saint Sundar Shah of Devnagar, fostering interfaith harmony through Sikh teachings."

Sundar Shah's disciples performed Muslim burial rites for him and cremated Bidhi Chand per Sikh traditions, erecting shrines for both. Later, Bidhi Chand's son, Lal Chand, retrieved sacred earth from the site and constructed a samadh (memorial) in their ancestral village of Sursingh."
