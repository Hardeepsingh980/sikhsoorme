      "value": "Bhai Lalo was born in 1452 in the village of Saidpur (present-day Eminabad in Pakistan) to Bhai Jagat Ram, a member of the Ghataura surname in the carpenter (Tarkhan) clan. Growing up in a modest environment, Lalo learned the trade of carpentry from his father and community. He was known from a young age for his unwavering honesty and hard work, earning a living through ethical labor in an era marked by social hierarchies and corruption under Mughal influence. Saidpur was a small town in Punjab, where craftsmanship was a respected but humble profession. (Sources: Wikipedia - Bhai Lalo section; SikhiWiki)"

      "value": "Bhai Lalo's primary contribution was his embodiment of Sikh ethical principles, particularly Kirat Karni‚Äîearning through honest means. He hosted Guru Nanak Dev and Bhai Mardana during their travels, providing them with shelter and simple meals earned from his labor. This act of seva (selfless service) extended to sharing his resources and spreading Guru Nanak's teachings in Saidpur. He also practiced herbal medicine (Vedic traditions) and aided the community, including curing the Sultan's son through humility and faith-guided remedies. His life service highlighted the equality of all castes, challenging the prevailing Hindu and Muslim social norms.

The famous sakhi with Malik Bhago reformed societal views on purity of earnings, emphasizing that honest poverty is superior to dishonest wealth. He promoted the three pillars of Sikhism: Naam Japo (meditation on God's name), Kirat Karni (honest work), and Vand Chakna (sharing with others). His legacy influenced the Ramgarhia community's rise as industrious Sikhs. (Sources: Wikipedia - Ramgarhia history; SikhiWiki)"
