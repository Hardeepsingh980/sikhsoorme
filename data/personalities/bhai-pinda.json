He is believed to have been born in the Punjab region during the mid-16th century, in a time when Sikhism was evolving under Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Guru Angad Dev Ji. As a Vaishnav Hindu initially (like many contemporaries), Bhai Pinda transitioned to Sikhism upon encountering the teachings of Guru Amar Das Ji. He became one of the 52 prominent disciples (Sikh sangat members) who dedicated their lives to the Guru's mission. His background likely involved rural life, possibly as a farmer or artisan, aligning with the egalitarian ethos of early Sikhism (citationNeeded from traditional accounts)."

      "value": "Bhai Pinda's primary contributions centered on selfless service (sewa) to Guru Amar Das Ji and the growing Sikh community. He was particularly noted for his role in the langar (community kitchen), where he performed menial tasks such as grinding spices (pounding in a mortar, hence possibly linked to his name \"Pinda\" evoking \"pind\" or service-related terms) and preparing meals for visitors regardless of caste or status. This service exemplified Guru Amar Das's reforms, emphasizing \"Pehle Pangat, Phir Sangat\" (first dine in the langar, then meet the Guru). Bhai Pinda traveled with the Guru, aiding in the establishment of manjis (preaching centers) across Punjab and beyond, helping propagate Sikhism in regions like Majha and Malwa. His dedication helped foster community unity during a period of social upheaval under Mughal influence (cross-verified from Sikh historical narratives)."

He actively discouraged practices like sati (widow immolation) and purdah (veiling) within the sangat. His service in langar directly challenged social hierarchies by serving food to all, including high-caste Hindus, Muslims, and outcastes. Bhai Pinda also assisted in constructing the Baoli Sahib at Goindwal (a sacred stepwell), symbolizing spiritual cleansing and equality (references: SikhWiki on Guru Amar Das; traditional Sikh biographies)."

As a loyal disciple, he would have supported the transition to Guru Ram Das Ji. Traditional accounts suggest he spent his final years in Goindwal Sahib, mentoring younger Sikhs in sewa and devotion (citationNeeded; based on anecdotal historical references)."
