      "value": "Bhai Vir Singh was born on December 5, 1872, in Amritsar, into a prominent Sikh scholarly family. He was the eldest of three sons of Dr. Charan Singh, a noted Braj poet, musicologist, and community leader, whose lineage traced back to Diwan Kaura Mall, a historical figure in Sikh-Mughal relations. His maternal grandfather, Giani Hazara Singh, was a renowned Sikh scholar and lexicographer who authored commentaries on Sikh scriptures. From a young age, Vir Singh received traditional Sikh education in Gurbani, Persian, Urdu, Sanskrit, and Braj Bhasha, alongside modern English education at the Church Mission School in Amritsar. He matriculated in 1891, topping his district. The conversion of classmates to Christianity during his school years strengthened his Sikh convictions, inspiring him to use literature as a tool for Sikh propagation, similar to missionary methods. At age 17, he married Chatar Kaur, with whom he had two daughters, and they lived a devoted family life in Amritsar."

      "value": "Vir Singh's contributions spanned literature, education, and social reform within the Singh Sabha movement, which aimed to revive Sikhism amid British colonial pressures and Hindu assimilation attempts. In 1894, he founded the Khalsa Tract Society to publish affordable tracts on Sikh theology, history, and reform, fostering community awareness. He launched the Punjabi weekly *Khalsa Samachar* in 1899, serving as its editor for years, and co-founded institutions like the Chief Khalsa Diwan (1902), Sikh Educational Conference (1908), and Punjab and Sind Bank (1908). His work emphasized Sikh distinctiveness, education for the masses, and assimilation of modern influences into Sikh heritage. He avoided direct politics, focusing on cultural and spiritual renewal, and promoted inter-community harmony while defending Sikh identity against proselytization."

      "value": "Bhai Vir Singh is credited with founding modern Punjabi literature, producing over 50 works across genres. His novels like *Sundri* (1898), *Bijay Singh* (1899), and *Satwant Kaur* (1900/1927) romanticized Sikh history. The epic *Rana Surat Singh* (1905, book form 1919) symbolized Sikh spiritual resilience in over 14,000 lines. Shorter lyrics such as *Dil Tarang* (1920) and *Matak Hulare* (1922) innovated forms like the Rubai from Urdu. Scholarly works include critical editions of *Puratan Janam Sakhi* (1926), *Sikhan di Bhagat Mala* (1912), and annotations of Bhai Santokh Singh's *Gur Pratap Suraj Granth* (1927‚Äì1935). His unfinished commentary on *Guru Granth Sahib* (published posthumously in 7 volumes) remains a monumental exegesis. Other notable works: *Panj Granthi* (1906), *Guru Nanak Chamatkar* (1912‚Äì1925), and plays like *Raja Lakhdata Singh* (1910)."

Fatigue from lifelong dedication set in 1957; he fell ill with fever and passed away on June 10, 1957, at age 84. His home, now a heritage site, preserves his legacy."
