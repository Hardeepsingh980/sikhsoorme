      "value": "Baba Sri Chand was born on 8 September 1494 (Bhadra sudi 9, 1551 Bikrami) in Sultanpur Lodhi to Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Mata Sulakhani. As Guru Nanak embarked on his extensive travels (Udasis), his mother took the young Sri Chand and his younger brother, Lakhmi Chand (later Baba Lakhmi Das), to her parental home in Pakkhoke Randhawa village near the Ravi River (present-day Dera Baba Nanak area). From a young age, Sri Chand displayed spiritual inclinations, showing indifference to worldly affairs. At age 11, he traveled to Kashmir to study Sanskrit literature under Pandit Purushottam Kaul and learned yoga from Avinasha Muni. By adulthood, he had embraced asceticism and celibacy, adopting a life of renunciation. Upon Guru Nanak's return in 1522 to Kartarpur, Sri Chand rejoined his family but continued his contemplative path. Historical accounts note his high regard for his father, despite philosophical differences‚ÄîGuru Nanak emphasized the householder's life (Grihastha), while Sri Chand favored ascetic withdrawal."

      "value": "As the founder of the Udasi sect (from \"Udasi,\" meaning indifference or renunciation), Baba Sri Chand established a tradition of ascetic sadhus who functioned as itinerant missionaries. He gathered disciples who practiced austerities and traveled across the Indian subcontinent, spreading awareness of Guru Nanak's teachings while promoting yoga, meditation, and devotion to five key deities (Surya, Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, and Shakti)‚Äîelements that aligned more with broader Indic traditions than core Sikh monotheism. His main center was at Barath, 8 km southwest of Pathankot. Sri Chand also maintained Sikh sites; after Guru Nanak's passing in 1539, he recovered his father's ashes from a flood-damaged shrine on the Ravi River and reburied them near Ajitta Randhawa's well in Pakkhoke Randhawa, leading to the development of Dera Baba Nanak as a sacred site. Successive Sikh Gurus, including Guru Ram Das and Guru Hargobind, held him in esteem; the latter sent his son Baba Gurditta (future Udasi patriarch) to study under him. In 1626, Sri Chand helped lay the foundation for Kiratpur town."

    {
      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Baba Sri Chand's reforms centered on asceticism within a Sikh-influenced framework, establishing Udasi akharas (monasteries) that preserved and propagated Sikh scriptures alongside Ayurvedic knowledge and Hindu texts. This sect played a crucial role in safeguarding Sikh historical shrines (e.g., Amritsar, Anandpur, Hazur Sahib) for over a century after Guru Gobind Singh's time. However, his promotion of celibacy, deity worship, and supernatural powers (siddhis) diverged from Sikh emphasis on the householder path and rejection of occult practices, as critiqued in Sikh texts like Bhai Gurdas' Varan and Satta-Balwand's composition in Guru Granth Sahib (p. 967), which notes his and his brother's non-adherence to Guru Nanak's word."

      "label": "Compositions/Writings",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Baba Sri Chand's most notable work is the *Arta Sri Guru Nanak Dev* (also known as *Aarta*), a 10-verse hymn praising Guru Nanak as the Supreme Lord, envisioning the sun, moon, elements, and creation singing His glory. Composed during one of his travels, it significantly influenced non-Sikhs unfamiliar with Guru Nanak. He proclaimed Guru Nanak's universal sovereignty, blending devotion with cosmic imagery. No other major writings are attributed, but Udasi traditions credit him with oral teachings on yoga and renunciation.

      "value": "In his later years, Baba Sri Chand continued traveling with his Udasi followers, maintaining ties with Sikh Gurus. He resided primarily at Dera Baba Nanak and Kiratpur. Traditions claim his extraordinary longevity (134 years), symbolizing spiritual endurance. He passed away (or \"vanished into the Chamba forest\" per Udasi lore) on 13 January 1629 (Magh sudi 1, 1685 Bikrami) at Kiratpur. His successor was Baba Gurditta, son of Guru Hargobind, linking Udasis to the Guru lineage. Udasis thereafter protected Sikh heritage amid Mughal persecution."
