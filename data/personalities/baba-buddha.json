Renowned for his wisdom, piety, and unwavering service, he was the first Head Granthi of Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) and played a pivotal role in key Sikh institutions, including the construction of the Akal Takht.

      "value": "Baba Buddha was born on October 6, 1506, in the village of Kathu Nangal, about 18 km northeast of Amritsar, Punjab, to a Randhawa Jat family. His father, Bhai Suggha (or Sugha) Randhawa, was a farmer, and his mother, Mai Gauran, hailed from a Sandhu family. Originally named Bura (meaning \"old\" or \"elderly\" in Punjabi, reflecting his family's humble agrarian roots), he was the only son. The family later relocated to Dhalla village near the Ravi River, opposite Kartarpur.  \n\nAs a child, Bura tended cattle outside his village. Around 1520‚Äì1521, at the age of 14‚Äì15, he encountered Guru Nanak Dev during one of the Guru's travels. Offering a bowl of milk, young Bura posed deep philosophical questions about life, death, and the indiscriminate nature of mortality‚Äîlikening death to marauding soldiers who spare neither the ripe nor the unripe. Impressed by his wisdom beyond his years, Guru Nanak renamed him \"Buddha\" (wise one) and initiated him as one of his earliest disciples. This encounter marked the beginning of his lifelong commitment to Sikhism. Bura married at 17 in Achal near Batala but prioritized spiritual pursuits, spending much time at Kartarpur. Historical context: This was during the early formative years of Sikhism (circa 1469‚Äì1539), amid Mughal influences and a syncretic Bhakti-Sufi spiritual landscape in Punjab."

      "value": "Baba Buddha's life was defined by exemplary seva (selfless service) to the Sikh Gurus, spanning over a century. He served as a close companion, administrator, and instructor, embodying the Sikh ideals of humility, devotion, and discipline. Key contributions include:  \n- **Installation of Gurus:** Performed the ceremonial tilak (anointing) for five successive Gurus: Guru Angad Dev (1539), Guru Amar Das (1552), Guru Ram Das (1574), Guru Arjan Dev (1581), and Guru Hargobind (1606). This role, entrusted by Guru Nanak despite his Jat background (considered lower caste in contemporary society), highlighted Sikhism's emphasis on merit over birth.  \n- **First Granthi of Harmandir Sahib:** On August 16, 1604, Guru Arjan appointed him as the inaugural Head Granthi (custodian and reciter) of the Adi Granth at the newly completed Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. He supervised its daily recitation and upkeep.  \n- **Construction and Administration:** Assisted in excavating the Amrit Sarovar (pool of nectar) under Guru Ram Das and Guru Arjan, founding the city of Amritsar. Co-built the Akal Takht (throne of the timeless) with Bhai Gurdas in 1606‚Äì1608, opposite Harmandir Sahib, symbolizing Sikh sovereignty. Administered Bhai Bhani's 500-bigha jagir (land grant) from Emperor Akbar, developing it into productive farmland and education centers (now Gurdwara Beer Baba Buddha Ji).  \n- **Martial Training:** Learned Shastar Vidya (Sikh martial arts) directly from Guru Nanak. Under Guru Hargobind, trained the nascent Sikh army (Akal Sena, later Budha Dal) and reformed Nihang warriors during the Guru's imprisonment.  \n- **Education and Propagation:** Learned and taught Gurmukhi script under Guru Angad to promote Sikh literacy. Tended livestock for Guru Ka Langar (community kitchen), retiring to Ber Sahib forest in Amritsar.  \n\nHis service bridged spiritual (piri) and temporal (miri) aspects, aiding Sikhism's transition from a devotional movement to a structured community amid Mughal persecution."

      "value": "- **Institutional Foundations:** Instrumental in establishing core Sikh institutions like Harmandir Sahib (egalitarian worship space open to all castes) and Akal Takht (center for temporal decisions). His appointment as Granthi formalized scriptural recitation as central to Sikh practice.  \n- **Miri-Piri Doctrine:** During Guru Hargobind's installation (1606), Baba Buddha presented two swords instead of the traditional seli (wool cord), symbolizing the balance of spiritual and worldly power‚Äîa reform responding to Guru Arjan's martyrdom and rising threats.  \n- **Social Equality:** As a Jat, his elevation to anoint Gurus challenged caste hierarchies, reinforcing Guru Nanak's teachings on equality (e.g., langar and pauri traditions).  \n- **Military Organization:** Reformed early Sikh defenses post-1606, training recruits in Shastar Vidya, laying groundwork for the Khalsa's martial ethos."

The Guru personally carried his bier to the funeral pyre, recited from the Adi Granth, and honored his son Bhana with a turban. Cremation occurred at Ramdas, where Gurdwara Samadhan Baba Buddha stands today. A continuous Akhand Path (scripture reading) was initiated in his memory, completed by Bhai Gurdas."
