      "value": "Bhai Bachittar Singh was born into a devout Sikh family of Parmar Rajput origin, as the second son of Bhai Mani Singh, a prominent Sikh scholar and childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh. His family hailed from the Dullat clan, with roots in Alipur village, Punjab. From a young age, Bachittar Singh was immersed in the Sikh tradition of service and martial training. His father presented five of his sons, including Bachittar Singh, for service to Guru Gobind Singh at Anandpur Sahib. On the historic Baisakhi day of 14 April 1699, he was among the first to join the Khalsa order, receiving the vows of the initiated Sikhs. This period marked the early 18th century, a time of escalating tensions between the Sikh community and Mughal forces, shaping his warrior ethos (SikhiWiki; Research_For_Personality)."

He participated in several key defenses of Anandpur Sahib against hill Rajas and Mughal-allied forces. His most notable service came during the first Siege of Anandpur in 1700, where he volunteered to confront an enemy elephant. He also fought in battles at Nirmohgarh and Basali. During the evacuation of Anandpur on 5-6 December 1705, he led a flanking guard to protect the retreating Sikhs, ensuring safe passage across the Sarsa rivulet for many, including the Guru (SikhiWiki; cross-verified with Research_For_Personality)."

Severely wounded, he was rescued and carried by Sahibzada Ajit Singh and Bhai Madan Singh to the safety of Kotla Nihang Khan's fort. Guru Gobind Singh personally instructed Nihang Khan to care for him, gifting a sword, dagger, and shield before proceeding to Chamkaur. Despite medical attention from Nihang Khan's daughter, Bachittar Singh succumbed to his injuries on 8 December 1705. His cremation was conducted secretly the following night to evade Mughal forces (SikhiWiki; date cross-verified, though one source notes 22 December - citationNeeded for discrepancy)."
