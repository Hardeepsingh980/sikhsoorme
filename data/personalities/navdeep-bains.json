In 2016, he received the prestigious Fellow of the Chartered Professional Accountants (FCPA) designation from CPA Ontario for his community leadership and achievements. Early career roles included financial processing analyst at Nike Canada (2000‚Äì2001) and revenue/costing analyst at Ford Motor Company (2000‚Äì2004), building his expertise in finance and business analysis.
