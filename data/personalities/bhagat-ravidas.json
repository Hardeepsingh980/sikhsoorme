      "value": "Bhagat Ravidas was born into a family of leather workers from the Chamar community, considered untouchable in the rigid Hindu caste system of medieval India. His father, Santokh Das (or Raghu Das in some accounts), and mother, Kalsi Devi (or Kalpeshvari), resided in Seer Govardhanpur, a village near Varanasi in present-day Uttar Pradesh. Traditional narratives, such as those in the Anantadas Parcai, describe him being blessed by the Bhakti saint Ramanand shortly after birth, marking his early spiritual inclination. As a child, Ravidas showed disinterest in the family trade, instead spending time in devotion along the banks of the Ganges River, associating with Sufi saints, sadhus, and ascetics. By age 12, he was married to Lona Devi, and they had a son, Vijay Das. His father, displeased by Ravidas's charitable spending of business earnings on the needy and saints, banished him from home. Ravidas then lived modestly in a hut, mending shoes by the roadside while deepening his spiritual practices (Sources: SikhiWiki, Wikipedia; cross-verified via hagiographical texts like Prem Ambodh and Anantadas Parcai)."

      "value": "Ravidas dedicated his life to spiritual pursuit and social upliftment, establishing a small clay temple where he installed a symbolic idol made from hide, attracting devotees from all castes despite opposition from orthodox Brahmins. He composed devotional poetry that preached monotheism, selfless service (seva), and the pursuit of God through inner devotion rather than ritualistic practices. His teachings influenced the Bhakti movement, promoting unity among Hindus, Muslims, and outcastes. He is credited with guiding disciples like Mirabai, the Rajput princess, and Maharani Jhally of Chittorgarh, demonstrating his cross-caste appeal. Ravidas also engaged in public discourses challenging untouchability, advocating that true devotion transcends social barriers (Sources: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki; citation needed for exact disciple list beyond Mirabai)."

      "value": "- **Anti-Caste Advocacy:** Ravidas was a pioneering voice against the caste system, declaring, \"I am lowly born, yet through devotion, I am exalted,\" inspiring Dalit movements today.  \n- **Gender Equality in Spirituality:** By accepting female disciples like Mirabai, he broke taboos on women's participation in religious life.  \n- **Promotion of Universal Brotherhood:** Influenced by Ramanand's teachings, he integrated Hindu, Sufi, and egalitarian ideas, fostering interfaith harmony during a time of Muslim rule in India.  \n- **Economic Altruism:** He rejected material wealth, famously ignoring a philosopher's stone gifted to test his detachment (Sources: SikhiWiki; Wikipedia; cross-verified in Bhakti literature)."

His poetry is in simple, accessible Hindi/Sant Bhasha, using metaphors from nature (e.g., water and waves for unity with God).
