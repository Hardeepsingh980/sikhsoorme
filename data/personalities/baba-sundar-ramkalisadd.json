      "value": "Baba Sundar was born into a sacred lineage as the great-grandson of Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru (r. 1552‚Äì1574). His father, Anand Das, was the son of Baba Mohri, Guru Amar Das's younger son, embedding Sundar in a family steeped in Sikh devotion. Raised in Goindval Sahib, a key Sikh center established by Guru Amar Das, Sundar grew up in an atmosphere of piety, faith, and reverence for the Guru tradition. From a young age, he developed profound affection for his great-grandfather, Guru Amar Das, whose teachings on humility, meditation on the Divine Name (Naam Simran), and surrender to God's Will shaped his worldview. Historical accounts suggest he lived a life of simplicity and spiritual immersion, far from worldly pursuits, reflecting the early Sikh ethos during the formative years of the faith under Mughal rule (citation: SikhiWiki)."

      "value": "Baba Sundar's primary contribution to Sikhism is his poetic composition *Ramkali Sadu*, a six-stanza hymn in Raag Ramkali included in the Guru Granth Sahib on Angs 923-924. This work serves as an elegy (sadd, meaning \"call\" or invocation) narrating Guru Amar Das's final moments, his merger with the Divine, and the seamless succession to Guru Ram Das (r. 1574‚Äì1581). It underscores Sikh teachings on death as a joyous union with Waheguru rather than a cause for mourning, advocating kirtan (devotional singing) over ritualistic funerals. Sundar also played a reconciliatory role later in life; during Guru Hargobind's (sixth Guru, r. 1606‚Äì1644) time, after skirmishes in Amritsar, he persuaded the Guru, his son Tegh Bahadur (future ninth Guru), and their entourage to seek refuge in Goindval, promoting peace and family ties (citation: SikhiWiki; Wikipedia - Baba Sunder). His life exemplified service through spiritual expression and familial devotion."
