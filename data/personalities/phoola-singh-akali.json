      "value": "Akali Phula Singh was born on January 14, 1761, in Shihan village in the Phulkian Misl area (present-day Sangrur district, Punjab) to a Jat Sikh family. His father, Sardar Ishar Singh, a member of the Shaheedan Misl, was fatally wounded in the Wadda Ghalughara (Great Holocaust) of 1762 and died shortly after. Orphaned young, Phula Singh and his elder brother Baba Sant Singh were cared for by Mahant Balram. At around age 10, under his mother's guidance, he was apprenticed to Akali Baba Naina Singh, leader of the Shaheedan Misl and Nihang order at Anandpur Sahib, where he received Khalsa initiation. A devout child, he memorized the Nitnem, Akal Ustat, 33 Savaiye, and other Mukhwak Banis, often fasting until completing daily recitations. At age 14, his mother died after falling down stairs, leaving him with final wishes to uphold dharma, serve the Panth, help the poor, and follow ancestral paths. Inspired, he renounced possessions, distributed land to the needy, and embraced the Nihang saint-soldier life. Training in martial arts at Anandpur Sahib, he fought battles, protected Gurdwaras from thieves, and prepared langar, earning the jathedari of the Shaheedan Misl for his Gurbani recitation and dharmic strength.

      "value": "Akali Phula Singh's service spanned spiritual, administrative, and military realms. In 1800, he arrived in Amritsar with 2,000 Nihangs to reform mismanaged Gurdwaras, becoming responsible for their upkeep across the region. He led kar seva at Harmandir Sahib, cleaning the complex with 100,000 pilgrims over two months, and later at Muktsar Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, and Damdama Sahib. As Jathedar of Akal Takht (from 1800), appointed by the Panj Pyare and Sangat, he enforced Sikh maryada, notably punishing Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1801 for marrying a Muslim woman (Moran), ordering him to appear before the Akal Takht and receive lashes, though forgiven by the Sangat. Militarily, he mediated the 1801 Amritsar siege, preventing Sikh infighting and aiding Ranjit Singh's unification. He led Nihang contingents in key campaigns: Kasur (1807, breaching the fort), Multan (1818, hand-to-hand assault), Kashmir (1819, conquering Shopian), Peshawar (1823, initial takeover). His Nirbhai Akhara in Amritsar housed thousands, providing langar to the poor. He resisted British advances, attacking surveys and processions, and advised against Europeanizing the army.

He led campaigns in Attock and Peshawar regions. In 1823, during the Battle of Nowshera against Azim Khan's forces, he upheld a Gurmata to charge without retreat. Despite wounds, he fought on elephantback, attaining martyrdom from a sniper's shot. Ranjit Singh mourned deeply, cremating him with honors. His samadhi at Pir Sabaq became a pilgrimage site.
