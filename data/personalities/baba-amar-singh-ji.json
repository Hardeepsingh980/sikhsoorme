      "value": "Baba Amar Singh Ji was born into a prominent Kamboj family in Khemkaran, Punjab, as Amar Chand, son of the wealthy landlord Raghupat Rai Nibbar. His family had historical ties to Mughal courts through ancestors who held royal positions. He had an elder brother, Mool Chand (also known as Bhai Mool Chand), a valiant warrior who fought alongside Guru Gobind Singh in battles, including the Battle of Nadaun on March 20, 1691, where he attained martyrdom. Baba Amar Singh was renowned for his exceptional physical strength and athletic build, standing over six and a half feet tall. After taking Amrit (Sikh initiation), he adopted the name Bhai Amar Singh and earned the nickname \"Bir\" (Knight) for his formidable prowess in battle, particularly his ability to wield a heavy double-edged sword (Khanda) weighing over 50 ser (approximately 20 kg) continuously. His early life was marked by participation in Sikh military efforts under Banda Singh Bahadur against Mughal oppression during the early 18th century.

      "value": "Following the martyrdom of Banda Singh Bahadur in 1716 during the siege of Lohgarh Fort, the Sikh forces split into the Bandai Khalsa (led by followers of Banda's practices) and the Tat Khalsa. Baba Amar Singh assumed supreme leadership of the Bandai Khalsa, defending Sikh interests amid Mughal persecution. He organized and led armed squads in resistance efforts, contributing to the survival and expansion of Sikh military traditions post-Banda. The Bandai faction, under his guidance, emphasized certain religious practices, such as the use of \"Rama\" and \"Hari\" mantras in place of \"Waheguru,\" and introduced rituals influenced by Bhakti traditions, which aimed to unify Sikh values but sparked controversy. His leadership helped maintain Sikh cohesion during a period of intense factionalism and external threats. (Sources: Wikipedia - Baba Amar Singh Nibbar; Gyani Gyan Singh, Panth Prakash)"

      "value": "As leader of the Bandai Khalsa, Baba Amar Singh introduced practices that sought to blend Sikh martial ethos with devotional elements, including specific prayer forms and community organization. These reforms were intended to strengthen Sikh religious identity but led to the 1721 Amritsar schism with the Tat Khalsa, who adhered strictly to Guru Gobind Singh's original Khalsa code. The reforms were partially resolved through arbitration, influencing the eventual Sikh Rehat Maryada (code of conduct). However, they are noted for their role in setting precedents for debates on Sikh orthodoxy. (citationNeeded for specific reform details; based on historical accounts of Bandai practices)"

Mata Sundari (widow of Guru Gobind Singh) intervened by appointing Bhai Mani Singh (also of Kamboj lineage) as Granthi of the Harimandir to arbitrate. Bhai Mani Singh facilitated reconciliation in 1722, convincing Baba Amar Singh to accept the Tat Khalsa's views on core Sikh practices, leading to the merger of the factions. Baba Amar Singh continued his service thereafter but faced further challenges. He reportedly died around 1732 in battle, solidifying his legacy as a unifier amid division.
