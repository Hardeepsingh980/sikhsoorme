      "value": "Bhai Trilochan Singh Panesar was born on November 18, 1937, in Mandalay, Burma, to Sadhoo Singh, who served in the British Indian Army during World War II and later in the Indian Railways. His early childhood was marked by tragedy; in 1942, during Japanese bombings, some family members were killed. As a five-year-old, he was rescued by his elder sister and brought to Punjab, India. His father reunited with him later. Trilochan received initial education in a village madrassa and a local school. He pursued higher education, earning a diploma in civil engineering from the Engineering College at Nilokheri, Haryana. Professionally, he joined the Public Works Department (PWD) Punjab, conducting survey work in challenging terrains like Rohtang Pass. He later worked on the construction of IIT Delhi and joined IARI Pusa in New Delhi, retiring as a technical officer. His early experiences of loss and displacement deeply influenced his commitment to humanitarian service."

      "value": "Veerji's life was defined by unwavering panthic sewa. He assembled teams of volunteers to clean major historical Gurdwaras in Delhi, earning the nickname \"Jhaaroo Wale Veerji.\" Daily, his group prepared and distributed langar (community kitchen meals) to thousands outside Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk. He extended services to train passengers, notably highlighted in Khushwant Singh's 2002 Tribune column \"No One Will Go Hungry\" for feeding pilgrims on the Sach Khand Express. Veerji distributed Sikh religious texts free of cost, discouraging commercialization, and campaigned for a vegetarian diet aligned with compassionate Sikh principles. His teams organized medical camps in prisons like Tihar Jail (Delhi), Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh, providing eye check-ups, spectacles, TB screenings, treatments, and clothing. He facilitated cremations for unclaimed bodies with police assistance, immunized communities against Hepatitis B, and cultivated crops on hired land to feed the poor. In emergencies, he led relief efforts for the 2001 Gujarat earthquake (building a 200-bed hospital in Limbdi), 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, 2004 Sarojini Nagar bomb blasts, 2008 Bihar floods, and 2014 Kashmir floods."

His efforts included constructing and repairing crematoriums, digging tube wells for clean water in Delhi, and building facilities like the Virdhashram hospital for long-term patient care. He contributed to infrastructure at Gurudwara Moti Bagh, the pond at Bangla Sahib, and multi-utility buildings at Gurudwara Bala Sahib."
