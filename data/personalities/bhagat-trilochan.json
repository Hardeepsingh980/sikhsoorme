      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Trilochan, whose name signifies \"three-eyed\" (seer of past, present, and future), was born around 1267 into a Vaishya (merchant) family in Barsi, located in the Solapur District of present-day Maharashtra, India (source: Mahankosh and Sikh traditions). Little is documented about his childhood, but he is believed to have been influenced by the Bhakti movement prevalent in medieval India. He either resided in or frequently visited Pandharpur, a major center of devotion to Lord Vitthal, and was a contemporary of the poet-saint Namdev, who referenced him in his hymns. Trilochan's early life was marked by a deep spiritual inclination, leading him to prioritize devotion over worldly pursuits, which later affected his domestic circumstances."

    {
      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Trilochan's primary contributions were through his poetic compositions that promoted monotheism and ethical living. He hosted numerous saints and devotees at his home, fostering a community of spiritual seekers. Legends describe him as exceptionally hospitable, even engaging a mysterious servant named Antarjami (the \"knower of hearts,\" interpreted as a divine figure) to serve holy men, highlighting his service-oriented life. His teachings influenced the Bhakti tradition and were later immortalized in Sikh scripture. Among Ravidassia communities, he is revered as \"Satgur Trilochan,\" with his bani (compositions) propagated alongside those of Ravidas, Kabir, Namdev, Sain, and Sadhna (source: Dera Sach Khand Ballan declaration, 2010)."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Trilochan critiqued superficial religious practices, such as ritualistic renunciation, pilgrimages without inner transformation, and caste-based hypocrisies. In one famous hymn, he challenged ascetics (Sannyasi, Jogi, etc.) for their outward appearances without cleansing the \"filth\" of the heart, advocating recognition of God within the self-lotus (source: Raag Gujari, p. 525). He emphasized karma's inescapable role in suffering and the need for devotion to the one Creator to transcend it, aligning with Sikh principles of equality and inner devotion over external forms."

      "label": "Compositions/Writings",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Trilochan contributed four shabads (hymns) to the Guru Granth Sahib, reflecting his monotheistic devotion and warnings against attachment to Maya (illusion). Key works include: - **Sri Raag, p. 92:** Admonishes mortals for forgetting death amid family attachments and calls for divine embrace. - **Raag Gujari, p. 525-526:** A dialogue satirizing hypocritical ascetics, stressing meditation on the Creator over empty rituals. - **Raag Dhanasari, p. 695:** Consoles his wife on worldly hardships by explaining karma through mythological examples (e.g., moon's stains despite divine associations, Shiva's enduring sin). These hymns, composed in medieval Hindi/Punjabi, total around 20-25 stanzas and focus on themes of transience, divine grace, and ethical living (cross-verified via SikhiToTheMax and Macauliffe's translations)."

Legends suggest that after the disappearance of his divine servant Antarjami‚Äîdue to his wife's inadvertent complaint‚ÄîTrilochan immersed himself deeper in contemplation and praise of God, dispelling his sorrow through devotion. He likely passed away in the late 13th or early 14th century, continuing his life of piety in Maharashtra's devotional circles (citationNeeded: exact details from oral traditions)."
