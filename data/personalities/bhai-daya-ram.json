  "excerpt": "Bhai Daya Singh, originally named Daya Ram, was the first of the Panj Pyare, the five beloved Sikhs initiated by Guru Gobind Singh Ji into the Khalsa on 30 March 1699. Renowned for his courage in offering his head to the Guru, he played a pivotal role in Sikh history, participating in battles and delivering the Zafarnama to Emperor Aurangzeb. His life exemplifies selfless service (sewa) and devotion, aligning with the query's mention of sewa at Darbar Sahib through his foundational contributions to the Khalsa tradition.",

      "value": "Bhai Daya Singh was born as Daya Ram in 1661 (or 1669 per some sources) in Lahore to a devout Sobti Khatri family. His father, Bhai Suddha Ji, was a follower of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji and frequently visited Anandpur Sahib. In 1677, the family permanently relocated to Anandpur Sahib to be closer to the Guru's darbar, seeking blessings from the young Guru Gobind Singh Ji (then Guru Gobind Rai). Daya Ram, already educated in Persian and Punjabi, immersed himself in the study of martial arts, classical literature, and Gurbani. This period shaped his intellectual and spiritual foundation, preparing him for his historic role. The social conditions in Mughal-dominated Punjab involved religious persecution, which influenced the family's devotion to Sikhism as a path of equality and resistance."

      "value": "Daya Ram's service (sewa) epitomized Sikh ideals of humility and sacrifice. He attended Guru Gobind Singh Ji's darbar, performing daily sewa and training in warfare amid escalating Mughal-Sikh conflicts. As the first Panj Pyare, he symbolized the birth of the Khalsa, a community of saint-soldiers. He fought in the battles of Anandpur (1700‚Äì1704) and escaped the siege of Chamkaur Fort on 7‚Äì8 December 1705 with Guru Ji and two others, evading Mughal forces. In 1705‚Äì1706, alongside Bhai Dharam Singh, he undertook the perilous mission of delivering the Zafarnama‚Äîa letter of victory and moral rebuke‚Äîto Emperor Aurangzeb in Ahmadnagar (Deccan). Unable to meet the emperor directly, Daya Singh ensured its delivery via intermediaries and prepared a copy that survives today. His sewa extended to establishing a Taksal (spiritual school) under Guru Ji's hukam, imparting Gurbani wisdom to the Sikh sangat, evolving into the Bhai Daya Singh Samparda."

Daya Singh Ji attained martyrdom (akhand jal samadhi) shortly thereafter in Nanded, aged about 47. His cremation site, shared with Bhai Dharam Singh, is marked by Angitha Sahib near the Godavari River, symbolizing eternal sewa."
