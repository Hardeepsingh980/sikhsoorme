      "value": "Sir Harpal Singh Kumar was born in 1965 in England to Sikh parents who were refugees displaced by the Partition of India in 1947. His family, originally from what became Pakistan, fled to India and endured refugee camps before relocating to England. His father initially worked as a factory sweeper before establishing a grocery store, embodying the resilience of post-Partition Sikh migrants. Kumar attended Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, London, and later studied Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where he earned Master of Engineering and Master of Arts degrees. He excelled academically, receiving the Mobil Prize, Metal Box Prize, and Hughes Prize. He further pursued an MBA at Harvard Business School, graduating with High Distinction as a Baker Scholar and winning the Ford Prize and Wolfe Prize. These early achievements laid the foundation for his career in healthcare and leadership (Sources: Wikipedia; cross-verified with Research_For_Personality search results)."
