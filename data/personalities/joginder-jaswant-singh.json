He was the first child of Lieutenant Colonel Jaswant Singh Marwah (1921‚Äìunknown, WWII veteran commissioned in 1943) and Jaspal Kaur (1923‚Äì2006). His paternal grandfather, Sepoy Atma Singh Marwah (1896‚Äì1968), was a WWI veteran who served as a drummer in the 1/67 Punjab Regiment, fighting in the Mesopotamian Campaign and Siege of Kut before being wounded and discharged in 1918. The family migrated to Patiala, Punjab, India, after the 1947 Partition. Raised in various army cantonments across northern India due to his father's transfers, Singh received early education at Catholic convent schools like St. Anne's in Secunderabad and St. Mary's Presentation Convent in Jammu (1956‚Äì1960). He later attended Model Academy in Jammu, matriculating in 1960. As an \"army brat,\" he imbibed military culture from a young age (citation: Wikipedia API summary)."
