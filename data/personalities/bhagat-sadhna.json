      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Sadhna was born around 1180 CE in Sehwan Sharif, in the Soomra kingdom of Sindh (present-day Pakistan), into a Muslim family of butchers. From a young age, he continued the family trade of slaughtering goats and selling meat, operating a shop near shady trees and a water source that attracted travelers, saints, and locals. Despite his lowly profession, Sadhna displayed a deep interest in spirituality during his adolescence. He engaged in profound discussions with passing saints and seekers, fostering his devotional inclinations amid a diverse cultural landscape influenced by Islamic, Hindu, and emerging Bhakti traditions (citation: SikhWiki)."
    },
    {
      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Sadhna's primary contribution lies in his spiritual teachings and the inclusion of his hymn in the Guru Granth Sahib, compiled by Guru Arjan Dev in 1604 CE. As part of the Bhakti movement, he preached the love of one God, emphasizing that true devotion transcends caste, profession, or ritual. He renounced his householder life after spiritual realizations, wandering North India (including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan) to spread messages of inner purity. His interactions challenged orthodox practices, such as using Shaligram stones (sacred to Vaishnavs) as meat weights to critique idolatry. He also mentored seekers and outwitted religious scholars in debates, promoting equality and devotion over superstition (cross-verified: SikhWiki; general Bhakti histories)."

      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "- Advocated against idol worship and ritualism, arguing that lifeless stones (Shaligrams) cannot impart divine wisdom; used them practically in his trade to demonstrate this.  \n- Promoted spiritual equality, rising from a \"lowly\" butcher caste to saintly status through devotion.  \n- Influenced interfaith harmony by blending Muslim and Hindu devotional elements, later embraced in Sikhism.  \nThese reforms aligned with broader Bhakti ideals of nirguna (formless) worship during a period of religious syncretism in medieval India (citationNeeded: Broader alignment with Kabir and Ravidas; specific to Sadhna from SikhWiki)."

    {
      "label": "Compositions/Writings",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Sadhna composed devotional poetry in Punjabi, with only one hymn (shabad) preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib (Raag Bilaval, page 858). The shabad reflects on the futility of external purity (e.g., bathing in rivers) without inner cleansing from vices like lust, anger, and greed. It underscores that the mind's devotion to God is paramount, regardless of one's profession or background. No other complete writings survive, though his teachings were orally transmitted (citation: Guru Granth Sahib; SikhWiki)."

      "label": "Final Years",

      "value": "In his later years, Sadhna traveled extensively, preaching in Punjab and surrounding regions. He spent his final days in Sirhind (modern Punjab, India), where he continued disseminating his philosophy of divine love. He is believed to have died there in the 13th century, and a mosque was constructed in his memory, preserved by local authorities. The site features 'T' art form paintings and Sirhindi bricks, serving as his primary memorial (citation: SikhWiki; local historical accounts)."
