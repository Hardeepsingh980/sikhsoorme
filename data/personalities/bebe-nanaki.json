      "value": "Bebe Nanaki was born in 1464 in the village of Chahal, located in the Lahore district of the Punjab region (now part of Pakistan). She was the daughter of Mehta Kalu (also known as Kalyan Chand Mehta), a local patwari (village accountant) from the Bedi Khatri clan, and Mata Tripta. As the first child, she was named Nanaki by her maternal grandparents, deriving from \"Nanakian,\" symbolizing the home of her maternal family. The honorifics \"Bebe\" (affectionate term for an elder sister or respected woman) and \"Ji\" (suffix of respect) were later added to her name.\n\nNanaki's early years were spent in a traditional Hindu household in Talwandi (modern-day Nankana Sahib, Pakistan), amid the socio-religious milieu of 15th-century Punjab under the Delhi Sultanate. At the age of six (in 1470, per some accounts, or 11 per others), she displayed early signs of compassion and protectiveness, particularly toward her younger brother, Nanak, born five years later in 1469. Sikh traditions portray her as maternal in her care for Nanak, shielding him from their father's occasional frustrations over his disinterest in formal education and worldly pursuits. Historical sakhis (anecdotes) emphasize her intuitive understanding of Nanak's philosophical bent, setting the stage for her role as his lifelong supporter.\n\nCross-verification: Birth year and place consistent across Wikipedia and SikhiWiki; exact age at events varies slightly but aligns with traditional timelines."

      "value": "Bebe Nanaki's life was defined by her devotion to her brother, whom she recognized as spiritually enlightened from a young age. At 15, when Nanak showed reluctance toward conventional employment, Nanaki and her husband, Bhai Jai Ram, facilitated his move to Sultanpur Lodhi around 1484‚Äì1485. Jai Ram, a revenue official (modi) under Nawab Daulat Khan Lodhi, secured Nanak a position managing the royal granaries, providing financial stability during Nanak's early spiritual explorations.\n\nShe played a pivotal role in Nanak's personal life, including arranging his marriage to Mata Sulakhani in 1487, daughter of Baba Mool Chand from Pakhoke village (Gurdaspur district). Childless herself, Nanaki doted on Nanak's sons, Baba Sri Chand (born 1494) and Baba Lakhmi Das (born 1497), treating them as her own and helping raise them during family visits to Sultanpur.\n\nNanaki is credited as the first to embrace Nanak's teachings, becoming the inaugural Gursikh. She inspired his use of music in devotion by gifting him a Rebab (a stringed instrument), recognizing his musical talent as a tool for spreading divine messages. Throughout Nanak's udasis (missionary journeys starting 1496), she remained a steadfast anchor, hosting him during returns to Sultanpur and offering emotional support against societal opposition.\n\nHer service extended to protecting Nanak from familial and societal pressures, embodying Sikh ideals of selfless love (pyaar) and equality. In the broader context, her quiet devotion laid foundational support for Sikhism's emergence amid rigid caste hierarchies and ritualistic Hinduism.\n\nCross-verification: Role in employment and marriage confirmed in both Wikipedia and SikhiWiki; inspiration for Rebab noted in Wikipedia (citation: Singha, 2000)."

Sensing her impending death in 1518, she expressed a final wish for Nanak to be by her side, which he fulfilled during one of his visits. She passed away peacefully in his presence, with accounts stating that Nanak recited the Japji Sahib (his foundational composition) during her last moments, symbolizing her deep spiritual bond.\n\nThree days later, Bhai Jai Ram also died, and Nanak performed their funeral rites, underscoring the family's unity. Her death marked the end of an era of intimate sibling support for the nascent Sikh faith. Posthumously, gurdwaras like Gurdwara Bebe Nanaki Janam Asthan in Sultanpur honor her legacy.\n\nCross-verification: Death details consistent across sources; recitation of Japji noted in SikhiWiki sakhis (citation needed for exact wording, but traditional)."
