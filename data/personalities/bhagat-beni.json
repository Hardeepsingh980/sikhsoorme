      "value": "Little is known about Bhagat Beni's early life due to scarce historical records. He is believed to have been born in northern India around the mid-15th century, making him a contemporary of Guru Nanak Dev (1469‚Äì1539). Described as a well-educated scholar with a humble temperament, Beni spent much of his time in prayer and meditation, often neglecting household needs in pursuit of spiritual absorption. His Vaishnavite background placed him within the Bhakti tradition, focusing on devotion to Vishnu and the rejection of superficial religious practices. No specific family details or formative events are documented, but his writings suggest a life dedicated to self-realization and service to the true Guru."

      "value": "Bhagat Beni's primary contribution to Sikhism is his Bani (compositions), which were selected by Guru Arjan Dev for inclusion in the Adi Granth (later Guru Granth Sahib) in 1604. As one of the 15 Bhagats whose writings are enshrined in Sikh scripture, his hymns promote universal spiritual truths, bridging Vaishnavite devotion with Sikh principles. He served as a spiritual guide, denouncing ritualism and advocating for inner devotion. His emphasis on the \"tenth door\" (mystical union with God) influenced Sikh meditative practices. Beni is also noted for refusing pilgrimages, declaring the true sacred place to be within the self, as referenced in his Ramkali hymn."

Full texts are available in standard Gurbani translations (e.g., Srigranth.org)."
