      "value": "Limited historical records exist about Bhai Lalo's mother, as Sikh sakhis often focus on collective family devotion rather than individual names for women of this era. She was likely born in the mid-15th century in Saidpur (Eminabad), a village in the Punjab region under early Mughal influence. As part of the Ghataura (carpenter) clan, now associated with the Ramgarhia community, she would have lived a life of honest labor in a modest household. Her son, Bhai Lalo (born 1452), was a carpenter who earned through ethical means, reflecting family values. The social conditions of the time included rigid caste systems and emerging religious syncretism, setting the stage for Guru Nanak's transformative teachings. (citationNeeded for exact birth details, based on inferred timeline from Bhai Lalo's life)."

When Guru Nanak and Bhai Mardana arrived, Bhai Lalo welcomed them, but it was the mother's role in preparing a simple meal of dry chapati (roti) from her pure kitchen that became legendary. Guru Nanak praised the household's purity, stating that every place is clean for the divine, and the meal was served outdoors. This act of seva (selfless service) exemplified hospitality without ostentation. Later, in the confrontation with Malik Bhago (a corrupt official), Guru Nanak used her roti to demonstrate honesty‚Äîmilk dripped from it, symbolizing nourishment from truthful earnings. Her home became a site of spiritual discourse, where Guru Nanak taught the three pillars of Sikhism: Naam Japo (meditation on God), Kirat Karni, and Wand Chakna. She supported her son's devotion, fostering an environment that attracted pilgrims and spread Guru's message locally."
