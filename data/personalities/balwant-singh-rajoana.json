  "excerpt": "Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana is a prominent Sikh political activist and self-proclaimed prisoner of conscience, convicted for his role in the 1995 assassination of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh. A former Punjab Police constable, Rajoana openly confessed to the plot, citing grievances over the 1984 anti-Sikh violence and alleged extrajudicial killings during the Punjab insurgency. Sentenced to death in 2007, his execution has been stayed multiple times amid widespread Sikh community support, including protests and clemency appeals. He remains a symbol of resistance in modern Sikh activism.",

      "value": "Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana was born on 23 August 1967 into a devout Sikh family in the rural village of Rajoana Kalan, near Raikot in Punjab's Ludhiana district. Growing up amid the socio-political turbulence of post-Partition India, Rajoana developed a keen interest in literature from a young age. He was particularly fond of reading ghazals, novels, and poetry, which shaped his ideological worldview. Works by renowned Punjabi writers such as Surjit Paatar and Jaswant Singh Kanwal profoundly influenced his thoughts on social justice, identity, and resistance against oppression (citation: Wikipedia). As a young man, he joined the Punjab Police as a constable, serving during the height of the Khalistan separatist movement in the 1980s and early 1990s. This period was marked by intense state repression, including Operation Blue Star (1984) and the subsequent anti-Sikh riots, which left deep scars on the Sikh community and reportedly radicalized many, including Rajoana."

      "value": "Rajoana's primary \"contribution\" in historical narratives is his involvement in the assassination of Beant Singh, seen by supporters as an act of retribution against alleged state atrocities. During Beant Singh's tenure as Chief Minister (1992‚Äì1995), Punjab witnessed widespread allegations of extrajudicial executions, disappearances, and torture targeting Sikh militants and civilians‚Äîestimates suggest over 25,000 Sikhs were affected (citation: Wikipedia; cross-verified with SikhWiki reports on insurgency context). As a police constable disillusioned with the system, Rajoana conspired with fellow officer Dilawar Singh Babbar (Jaisinghvala) to target Beant Singh. On 31 August 1995, Dilawar executed a suicide bombing at the Punjab Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh, killing Beant Singh and 17 others. Rajoana served as the backup human bomb, positioned to detonate if the primary attack failed. Post-arrest, Rajoana's open confession and refusal to seek clemency elevated him to a symbol of Sikh defiance. He has authored letters from prison critiquing the Indian judiciary for \"dual standards,\" particularly in failing to prosecute 1984 riot perpetrators, inspiring ongoing activism for Sikh rights (citation: SikhWiki letters and timelines)."

In 2012, execution was halted days before 31 March following appeals by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Punjab government. The Supreme Court and President have deferred multiple times. In recent years (as of 2023), Union Home Minister Amit Shah referenced the case in Lok Sabha, indicating ongoing legal deliberations (citation: Wikipedia, incomplete reference). Rajoana continues to reject clemency, viewing himself as a martyr for the Sikh cause. His health and daily life in jail are monitored, with reports of solitary confinement and limited visitor access (citation: SikhWiki timelines; \"citationNeeded\" for post-2012 health details)."

His stance embodies Sikh ideals of standing against tyranny (as per Guru Tegh Bahadur's legacy) while rejecting compromise with oppressors.",
