      "value": "Bhai Sahib Singh was born on 17 June 1663 (or circa 1662-1665 per varying sources) in Bidar, Karnataka, into a humble Nai (barber) family. His father was Bhai Tirath Chand (or Tulsi Ram/Guru Narayana in some accounts), and his mother was Mata Devi Bai (or Bishan Devi). Bidar held historical significance as a site visited by Guru Nanak in the early 16th century, where a Sikh shrine was established. Growing up in this environment, Sahib Chand (his pre-Khalsa name) was influenced by Sikh teachings from a young age. Sikh traditions link him spiritually to Bhagat Sain, a 15th-century barber-saint whose hymn is included in the Guru Granth Sahib, portraying him as a reincarnation embodying humble devotion [citationNeeded for exact reincarnation claim; referenced in early Sikh literature like Mahankosh]. At age 16 (or 37 at Khalsa formation per SikhiWiki), he traveled to Anandpur Sahib and dedicated himself to Guru Gobind Singh, demonstrating marksmanship and bravery in battles, including slaying the Gujjar chief Jamatulla and wounding Raja Bhup Chand of Hindur."

      "value": "Bhai Sahib Singh's primary contributions were in military and spiritual service during a turbulent period of Mughal-Sikh conflicts. He participated in defenses of Anandpur Sahib against hill rajas and Mughal forces. His most profound service came on Vaisakhi, 30 March 1699 (Samvat 1756), when he was among the first five Sikhs to respond to Guru Gobind Singh's call for volunteers willing to sacrifice their lives, thus forming the Panj Pyare. Baptized into the Khalsa, he adopted the name Sahib Singh and the surname \"Singh,\" symbolizing lion-like courage. As part of the Khalsa nucleus, he helped administer Amrit (nectar of immortality) to others, including the Guru himself, establishing the order's egalitarian principles. He fought valiantly in subsequent battles, upholding Sikh sovereignty."

Some traditions credit him with oral contributions to Sikh martial ethos during Guru Gobind Singh's court [citationNeeded]. He is not known as a literary figure like Bhai Gurdas or Bhai Mani Singh, but his life inspired later Sikh ballads and janamsakhis.)"

On 7 December 1705, during the Battle of Chamkaur, Bhai Sahib Singh, alongside Bhai Himmat Singh and Bhai Mohkam Singh, fought heroically against overwhelming Mughal and hill raja forces. He attained shaheedi (martyrdom) on the battlefield, refusing surrender and embodying the Khalsa ideal of dying for faith. His sacrifice, at around age 42, occurred amid the broader persecution of Sikhs under Emperor Aurangzeb."
