His family immigrated to Canada in 1976 when he was five, settling in Vancouver, British Columbia, where his father worked in a sawmill and his mother on berry farms. Sajjan grew up in South Vancouver and was baptized as a Sikh in his teens to distance himself from negative influences, including associating with a classmate who later became a gangster. He married Kuljit Kaur, a family physician, in 1996; they have two children, Arjun and Jeevut [Wikipedia]."
