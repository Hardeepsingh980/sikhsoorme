He was likely born in the Punjab region during the late 16th or early 17th century, amidst the growing Sikh community under the Gurus. As a devoted Sikh, he came into the service of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, who transformed the Sikh faith into a more militarized and organized community in response to Mughal persecution. Bhai Gonda's piety and dedication made him suitable for missionary work (citationNeeded)."

      "value": "Bhai Gonda served as a masand, a key figure in the Sikh administrative and missionary system established by earlier Gurus and expanded under Guru Hargobind. In this role, he was dispatched to Kabul to preach the teachings of Guru Nanak and subsequent Gurus, establish local sangats (congregations), and collect dasvandh (one-tenth offerings) from Sikh followers in the region. Kabul had an emerging Sikh community due to trade routes connecting Punjab to Central Asia. His mission helped extend Sikhism's reach beyond Punjab into Afghan territories, fostering cultural and religious ties. He escorted offerings and groups of Sikhs back to the Guru in Amritsar, contributing to the sustenance of the langar (community kitchen) and other Sikh institutions. Historical accounts, including janamsakhis and Sikh chronicles, highlight his role in the story of horses Dilbagh and Gulbagh, which were brought from Kabul by masands like Bhai Gonda as gifts for the Guru (cross-verified with Bidhi Chand narratives)."

The system was eventually abolished by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 due to abuses by some masands. Bhai Gonda is remembered as an exemplary, non-corrupt masand who upheld the Guru's ideals (citationNeeded)."

Emperor Jahangir imprisoned Guru Hargobind, leading to a shift toward miri-piri (temporal-spiritual authority). Missionaries like Bhai Gonda were sent to strengthen Sikh networks amid persecution.",
    "socialConditions": "Punjab was a hub of religious syncretism with Hindus, Muslims, and emerging Sikhs. Trade routes to Kabul facilitated cultural exchange, but local populations in distant areas were diverse, including Pashtuns and merchants. The masand system addressed the need for organized outreach in a pre-modern communication era.",
    "significance": "Bhai Gonda's mission exemplified Sikhism's adaptability and missionary zeal, contributing to the faith's survival and growth. It highlighted the strategic use of masands to build an economic base (dasvandh) for resistance against imperial forces."
