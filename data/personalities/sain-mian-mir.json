      "value": "Born around 1550 in Sivistan, Sindh, to a family claiming descent from Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab, Mian Mir joined the Qadiri order of Sufism early in life. At age 25, he migrated to Lahore, settling in the neighborhood of Dharampura (now part of Lahore, Pakistan). He adopted a life of piety, shunning material wealth and worldly ambitions. His teachings emphasized unity of being (wahdat-al-wujud), love for the divine, and equality among all faiths. He built a simple hospice and gathered disciples (mureeds) who guarded his gate to prevent intrusions by the greedy elite."

      "value": "Mian Mir's life was marked by spiritual guidance and interfaith dialogue. He instructed prominent figures, including Mughal Prince Dara Shikoh, and founded the Mian Khel branch of the Qadiri order. In Lahore, he promoted Sufi practices of devotion, humility, and service to the needy. His sister, Bibi Jamal Khatun, was also a noted Sufi under his influence. Historically, he maintained a neutral stance with Mughal rulers like Jahangir, using encounters to teach lessons in humility‚Äîfamously directing a symbolic \"rupee of poverty\" to the emperor during a visit. His most significant contribution to Sikh history is his friendship with the Sikh Gurus, particularly Guru Arjan Dev, fostering bonds between Sufism and Sikhism during a period of religious synthesis in Punjab."

His funeral was led by disciple Dara Shikoh. Per his will, he was buried in Lahore beside friend Mian Natha Ji in what is now Hashimpur village. The shrine (Mazar Sharif) was later renovated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh."
