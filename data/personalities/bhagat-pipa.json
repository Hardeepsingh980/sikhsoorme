      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Pipa was born into a royal Rajput family in Gagaron, in the Malwa region of eastern Rajasthan, around 1425 CE (though dates vary). As a prince of the warrior class, he ascended to the throne of Gagaraungarh. Initially, he was a devotee of Shaivism (worshipping Shiva) and Shaktism (particularly Durga Bhavani), maintaining an idol of the goddess in his palace temple. His early life reflected the feudal Rajput traditions of the time, marked by royal duties and ritualistic worship amid the socio-political turbulence of medieval India under Delhi Sultanate influence."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Pipa's pivotal contribution was his abdication of the throne to pursue spiritual life, becoming a sanyasi (ascetic). He traveled to Varanasi, where he became a disciple of the Vaishnava saint Ramananda, joining the Ramanandi Sampradaya. This shift marked his entry into the Bhakti movement, preaching devotion to a formless (Nirguni) God. He influenced 52 Rajput chiefs from various clans (e.g., Chauhan, Solanki, Parmar), who renounced violence, alcohol, and meat to follow his teachings. As a wandering monk, Pipa spread messages of equality and inner divinity, impacting the broader Sant tradition. His legacy includes inspiring social reforms among warrior communities, fostering non-violence in a era of conflict."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhagat Pipa composed devotional poetry in the Bhakti tradition, with one hymn (shabad) included in the Guru Granth Sahib (on pages 1361‚Äì1362, in Raga Asa). His works, such as references in \"Sri Vaishnav Dharm Mangalam,\" focus on themes of divine immanence and ethical living. Other attributed writings include verses in Bhaktamala hagiographies, but primary compositions are oral and hymn-based. His bani reflects influences from Ramananda and prefigures Sikh Gurbani in its monotheistic, egalitarian tone (cross-verified with SikhWiki and Encyclopedia of Sikhism)."

Hagiographies like Bhaktamal describe miraculous episodes, such as converting robbers into disciples through compassion. He deepened his Nirguni devotion, similar to contemporaries like Kabir. Pipa is believed to have passed away around 1400 CE (traditional estimate; citationNeeded due to date conflicts), settling in Rajasthan, where his samadhi (memorial) exists in Gagraun."
