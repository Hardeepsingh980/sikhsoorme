      "value": "Bhai Gurdas was born in 1551 (exact date uncertain) in Basarke Gillan village, Punjab, into the Bhalla clan of Khatris. He was the only child of Bhai Ishar Das, the youngest brother of Guru Amar Das, making him the nephew of the third Sikh Guru. His mother, Mata Jivani, died when he was about three years old, and his father passed away when he was 12, leaving him orphaned. Adopted by Guru Amar Das, Bhai Gurdas received patronage and education at Goindval and Sultanpur Lodhi. He studied Sanskrit, Braj Bhasha, Persian, and Punjabi, immersing himself in Hindu scriptures at Varanasi and gaining knowledge from visiting scholars along the Delhi-Lahore route. By his late teens, under Guru Ram Das, he began missionary work, preaching Guru Nanak's teachings in Agra and other regions. This period shaped him into a multifaceted scholar, blending Sikh philosophy with broader literary traditions (cross-verified from Wikipedia and SikhiWiki; birth place discrepancy noted‚ÄîSikhiWiki cites Goindval as early residence)."

From 1588 to 1604, he served as the primary scribe (amanuensis) for Guru Arjan Dev in compiling the Adi Granth, the precursor to the Guru Granth Sahib, meticulously inscribing hymns from six Gurus and 15 saints (Sufi and Bhakti traditions). He supervised four other scribes and ensured accuracy over 19 years. As a missionary (sangatia), he traveled extensively‚Äîto Agra, Lucknow, Varanasi, Burhanpur, Rajasthan, Jammu, Chamba hills, Kabul, Kashmir, Rajputana, and even Sri Lanka‚Äîspreading Sikh teachings and reciting Gurbani. In 1596‚Äì97, he recited hymns to Emperor Akbar at Kartarpur, impressing the emperor and dispelling claims of anti-Muslim content. He contributed labor to excavating the Amrit Sarovar in 1577 and co-constructed the Akal Takht in 1606 with Baba Buddha under Guru Hargobind, laying its foundation without external masons. Appointed Jathedar of Akal Takht in 1612 during Guru Hargobind's imprisonment, he upheld Sikh authority. He also tutored young Guru Tegh Bahadur in classics (sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki; cross-verified for consistency)."

His magnum opus, *Varan Bhai Gurdas* (also *Varan Gyan Ratnavali*), comprises 40 Vaars (chapters) with 912 Pauris in Punjabi, offering vivid expositions of Sikh theology, ethics, and the lives of the Gurus. Guru Arjan Dev praised it as the \"key\" to the Guru Granth Sahib. He also authored *Kabitt Savaiyye Bhai Gurdas* in Braj Bhasha, including 672 Kabits and 3 Swayyas, discovered in full in 1939 by Bhai Vir Singh (adding 119 Kabits to the known 556). Additionally, he composed 6 Chhands of 8 verses each in Sanskrit. Themes include monotheism, devotion, social equality, and critiques of ritualism, drawing from Gurbani while incorporating broader South Asian literary styles. His works are recited in Gurdwaras and studied for their rhythmic, metaphorical style (cross-verified: Wikipedia lists exact counts; SikhiWiki emphasizes philosophical depth)."

Never married, he lived ascetically, focused on preaching and writing. He died on 25 August 1636 (SikhiWiki cites 23 September 1637; prevailing scholarly view favors 1636 per Gurbilas Patshahi 6) in Goindval, where Guru Hargobind personally conducted his funeral rites (citationNeeded for exact death date discrepancy)."
