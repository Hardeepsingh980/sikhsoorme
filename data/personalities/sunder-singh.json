      "value": "Baba Sunder Singh was born into a deeply pious Sikh family in the 16th century, likely in Goindval Sahib, Punjab, during the formative years of Sikhism under the third Guru, Guru Amar Das (his great-grandfather). His father, Anand Das, was the son of Baba Mohri, Guru Amar Das's younger son, creating a direct lineage to the Guru tradition. Raised in an atmosphere of faith and devotion, Sunder developed profound reverence for Guru Amar Das from a young age. Historical accounts describe his childhood as serene and spiritually inclined, immersed in the teachings of the Gurus. Limited details exist on his formal education, but as a Gursikh, he was influenced by the Guru's emphasis on Naam Simran (meditation on the Divine Name) and community service (Sewa). This environment shaped his poetic expression, reflecting Sikh values of humility and surrender to God's will.

      "value": "Baba Sunder's primary contribution to Sikhism is his poetic composition, which immortalized the spiritual ethos of the Guru lineage. He served the Sikh community by documenting the divine transition at Guru Amar Das's passing, reinforcing the concept of the eternal Guru spirit transcending physical forms. His work promoted kirtan (devotional singing) as a path to spiritual liberation and discouraged ritualistic mourning, aligning with Sikh reforms against Hindu customs. As a descendant of the Guru family, he likely participated in early Sikh gatherings at Goindval, fostering unity among followers. Historical context places him amid the expansion of Sikhism in Punjab, where Gurus established baolis (sacred wells) and langar (community kitchens) to promote equality.

These ideas supported Guru Amar Das's broader reforms, such as the Anand Karaj marriage rite and anti-caste practices, helping Sikhism emerge as a distinct faith.
