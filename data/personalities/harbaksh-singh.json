      "value": "Harbaksh Singh was born on October 1, 1913, in Badrukhan village near Sangrur in the princely state of Jind, into a prominent Madahar Jat Sikh family. As the youngest of seven siblings, he grew up in a milieu shaped by military tradition‚Äîhis father, Dr. Harnam Singh, was the village's first doctor and served in the Jind Infantry, participating in the Tirah Campaign (1897-1898) and World War I's East African Campaign. The Jind Infantry was later integrated into the Indian Army's Punjab Regiment in 1952. Singh received his early education at Ranbir High School in Sangrur and later attended Government College, Lahore, where he excelled in sports, particularly hockey, as part of the college team. Despite being a resident of a princely state, he obtained permission from Punjab Governor Sir Geoffrey Montmorency to enroll in the inaugural Indian Military Academy (IMA) course at Dehradun in March 1933."

He then joined the 5th Battalion, 11th Sikh Regiment (formerly 47th Sikhs) in Aurangabad in 1936, rising to command Alpha Company by 1938 in Razmak, NWFP. During World War II, his battalion deployed to Malaya; Singh was severely wounded in a Japanese ambush during the withdrawal from Kuantan on January 5, 1942, requiring a steel plate in his head‚Äîa lifelong reminder. Captured after the Fall of Singapore (February 15, 1942), he endured three years as a POW in Kluang camp, suffering typhoid and beriberi alongside his brother, Lt. Col. Gurbakhsh Singh. Repatriated in September 1945, he recovered in Ambala before resuming service as second-in-command of 4th Sikh.  \nPost-independence, as second-in-command of 161 Brigade, he decisively repelled invaders at the Battle of Shalateng (November 7-8, 1947), saving Srinagar from capture. Promoted to command 163 Brigade, he led a flanking offensive in 1948, capturing Tithwal by May 23 after crossing the Nasta Chun Pass, securing the Jhelum Valley up to Muzaffarabad. He commanded 5th Division and IV Corps, served in the 1962 Sino-Indian War (though controversially relieved during the second phase), and took over 33 Corps before assuming Western Command in November 1964. In the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, he orchestrated the defense against Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Asal Uttar, stabilizing the front despite heavy losses and defying orders to withdraw, preventing a potential Pakistani breakthrough into Punjab. His calm leadership under pressure, including repulsing operations in Kutch (April 1965) and Sialkot, was instrumental in India's tactical successes."
