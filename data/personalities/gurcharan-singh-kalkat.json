      "value": "Gurcharan Singh Kalkat was born on June 17, 1926, in Punjab, British India (now India), into a Sikh family during a period of colonial rule and agricultural challenges. He pursued his passion for agriculture early on, graduating with a bachelor's degree in agriculture from Punjab Agricultural College, Lyallpur (now Faisalabad, Pakistan) in 1947, coinciding with India's independence and the partition. He later earned a master's degree in agriculture from the University of Punjab in 1956. As a Rockefeller Fellow, he traveled to the United States, completing his PhD in agricultural entomology at Ohio State University in Columbus in 1958. This international exposure equipped him with advanced knowledge in crop protection and production techniques, which he brought back to a newly independent India facing food security crises."
