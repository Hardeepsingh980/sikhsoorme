      "value": "Bhai Man Singh was born in Alipur, a village in the Muzaffargarh district of present-day Pakistan, to Mal Das, in the late 17th century. Little is documented about his early years, but he hailed from a family devoted to Sikhism. He was the brother of Bhai Mani Ram, a prominent Sikh whose five sons were among the first initiated into the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh on Vaisakhi, 30 March 1699, at Anandpur Sahib. This familial connection likely drew Bhai Man Singh into the Sikh fold during the turbulent period of Guru Gobind Singh's leadership, amid growing Mughal persecution of Sikhs. As a young man, he joined the Guru's retinue, embodying the emerging martial spirit of the Khalsa."

      "value": "Bhai Man Singh served as both an ensign (flag-bearer) and a frontline warrior in Guru Gobind Singh's army during the sieges of Anandpur Sahib in the late 1690s and early 1700s. He fought valiantly in the intense battles against Mughal and hill king forces, demonstrating unwavering loyalty. Notably, he participated in the Battle of Chamkaur on 7 December 1704, where a small band of Sikhs, including the Guru, faced overwhelming odds. Bhai Man Singh was one of only three Sikhs who survived the battle and escaped with Guru Gobind Singh, protecting the Guru amid heavy losses. Following Chamkaur, he remained in constant attendance to the Guru during the arduous journeys southward. His service exemplified the Khalsa ideals of courage and devotion, contributing to the preservation and propagation of Sikh teachings through his actions as a living example of Sikh resilience."

      "value": "After the Battle of Chamkaur, Bhai Man Singh accompanied Guru Gobind Singh on his southward march following the evacuation of Anandpur. In early 1708, during the Guru's travels with Emperor Bahadur Shah's camp, a minor dispute between Sikh and Mughal foraging parties escalated into a skirmish near Chittor, Rajasthan (or possibly near the River Narmada, as per varying accounts). Sent by the Guru to intervene and resolve the conflict peacefully, Bhai Man Singh was struck by a stray bullet and died on the spot, approximately 3 April 1708. His death marked the end of a dedicated life in service to the Guru, occurring at a critical juncture when Sikhism was transitioning from persecution to broader alliances."
