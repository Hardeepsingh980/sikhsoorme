      "value": "Born on June 4, 1904, in Rajewal (Rohno), Ludhiana district, Punjab, as Ramji Das into a Hindu family. After his father's death, his mother, Mehtab Kaur, worked as a domestic helper to support his education. He attended schools in Khanna and Lahore's Khalsa High School. Although he found formal education uninteresting due to its theoretical nature, he spent significant time reading in the Dyal Singh Library in Lahore, accumulating vast knowledge. During his time in Lahore, he frequented Gurdwara Dehra Sahib and Gurdwara Shahid Ganj, performing selfless service (sewa) such as providing water, managing cattle, cleaning, and serving in the Langar. This exposure deeply influenced him, leading him to convert to Sikhi and take Khanda-da-Amrit in 1923, adopting the name Bhagat Puran Singh. His mother instilled in him a deep sense of compassion, teaching him to care for all living beings and the environment from a young age."

In 1934, he took responsibility for a four-year-old boy with leprosy named Piara Singh, who had been abandoned at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib. This act marked a pivotal moment in his life, solidifying his mission. Following the partition of India in 1947, he worked tirelessly in a refugee camp in Amritsar, treating the wounded and collecting food and medicine for over 25,000 refugees with minimal resources. His personal sacrifices were immense; from 1947 to 1958, he had no permanent home, walking the streets, and collecting donations for the poor and needy."
