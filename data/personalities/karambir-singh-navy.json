As a second-generation officer, he was inspired by his father's legacy in the armed forces. He attended Barnes School in Deolali, Maharashtra, before joining the 56th course at the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Khadakwasla, where he was part of the Hunter Squadron. An alumnus of the prestigious Defence Services Staff College in Wellington and the College of Naval Warfare in Mumbai, Singh's early education laid a strong foundation in strategic thinking and leadership. His Sikh upbringing, in the vibrant cultural milieu of post-Partition Punjab, instilled values of resilience and national duty, shaping his path toward a career in naval aviation (citation: Wikipedia, \"Early life and education\" section)."

He amassed extensive flying hours on HAL Chetak, Kamov Ka-25, and Kamov Ka-28 helicopters, becoming the \"Grey Eagle\"‚Äîthe senior-most serving naval aviator. His command roles included the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS Chand Bibi, corvette INS Vijaydurg (K71), guided-missile destroyer INS Rana (D52)‚Äîduring which it served as flagship for the 2005 Presidential Fleet Review‚Äîand lead destroyer INS Delhi (D61). In staff positions, he served as Fleet Operations Officer for the Western Fleet, Joint Director of Naval Air Staff at NHQ, and Captain of the Air at Naval Air Station Mumbai. Promoted to flag rank, he was Chief of Staff at Eastern Naval Command, led the Tri-Services Command in Andaman & Nicobar, and oversaw Project Seabird (development of INS Kadamba at Karwar). As Deputy and Vice Chief of Naval Staff, he influenced naval policy. He commanded Eastern Naval Command from October 2017 before ascending to CNS on May 31, 2019, succeeding Admiral Sunil Lanba. During his tenure, he advanced indigenous shipbuilding, enhanced maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region, and fostered bilateral ties, including visits to Japan, the US, and Sri Lanka (citation: Wikipedia, \"Career\" section; Indian Navy official records)."
