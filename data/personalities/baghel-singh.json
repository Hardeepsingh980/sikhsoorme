      "value": "Baghel Singh was born around the 1730s in the village of Jhabal Kalan in the Tarn Taran district of Punjab, into a Dhaliwal Jat family. His ancestors, including Chaudhary Bhai Langaha Dhillon and Bhai Pero Shah Dhillon (grandfather of Mai Bhago), had converted to Sikhism during the time of Guru Arjan Dev in the late 16th century. Growing up amid the turbulent period of Mughal persecution and Afghan invasions under Ahmad Shah Durrani, Baghel Singh joined the Singh Krora (Karora Singhia) Misl, one of the 12 Sikh Misls formed by Guru Gobind Singh. He rose through the ranks as a skilled warrior and strategist. Following the early death of Misl leader Karora Singh in 1765, Baghel Singh succeeded him at around age 30‚Äì35, inheriting a force of approximately 12,000 fighters. His early career involved consolidating Sikh territories in the Jalandhar Doab after the Sikh victory over Sirhind in 1764, establishing headquarters in Hariana (near Hoshiarpur), where his wife Rup Kanwar managed administration (Wikipedia; SikhiWiki)."

He acquired large portions of Hoshiarpur and one-fourth of the Jalandhar Doab, setting up secondary bases in Chhalondi and Kalawar under his other wives' governance. His military campaigns included:  \n- In 1764, leading the Budha Dal (40,000 Sikhs) under Jassa Singh Ahluwalia into the Ganga Doab, sacking Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut, and extracting 11 lakh rupees from Najib ud-Daulah.  \n- Raids into Rohilkhand (1764), plundering Najibabad and Moradabad.  \n- In 1775, crossing the Yamuna with allies, capturing towns like Gangoh and Deoband, and destroying Mughal outposts near Delhi.  \n- Temporary alliance with Mughals against Patiala in 1779, which he later turned against them, defeating imperial forces.  \n- Victory at the Battle of Ghanaur (1778) against a 100,000-strong Mughal army led by Nawab Majad ud Daula.  \nHis diplomatic skills secured tributes from regional nawabs and alliances, protecting Sikh communities while funding further expansions (SikhiWiki; Historical searches)."
