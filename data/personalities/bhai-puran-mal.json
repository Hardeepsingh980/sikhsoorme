      "value": "Limited historical records exist on Bhai Puran Mal's early life. Born in the Punjab region during the late 16th or early 17th century, he likely came from a Sikh or Hindu background sympathetic to the emerging Sikh faith. The socio-political turmoil under Mughal rule, marked by religious persecution, drew many able-bodied men like him to the Sikh Gurus for protection and purpose. He is believed to have joined Guru Hargobind's following in the 1610s, during the Guru's shift toward militarization following the martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev in 1606 (citationNeeded: Specific joining date from oral traditions)."

      "value": "Bhai Puran Mal served as a trusted military general and advisor to Guru Hargobind, who transformed the Sikh community into a martial force (miri-piri doctrine). He participated in several key battles, including the Battle of Amritsar (1628) against Mughal forces led by Abdul Shah and Hurmat Khan. As an advisor, he helped organize the Sikh defense strategies, training volunteers and fortifying positions around Amritsar. His loyalty was evident in his role in protecting the Guru and the sangat (congregation) from imperial threats. Historical texts like the \"Guru Har Rai Prakash\" mention his tactical acumen in skirmishes (cross-verified with Wikipedia's page on Guru Hargobind)."

He aided in the creation of a standing army of saint-soldiers, blending spiritual devotion with martial readiness. No individual reforms attributed directly to him, but his advisory role influenced the Guru's policies on self-defense (citationNeeded: Detailed advisory contributions from lesser-known janamsakhis)."
