      "value": "Bhai Vir Singh was born on December 5, 1872, in Amritsar, into a prominent Sikh family tracing ancestry to Diwan Kaura Mall, a 18th-century governor of Multan. His father, Dr. Charan Singh (1853‚Äì1908), was a Braj poet, musicologist, and lexicographer actively involved in Sikh community affairs. His grandfather, Baba Kahn Singh (1788‚Äì1878), was a recluse-turned-scholar fluent in Sanskrit, Braj, and oriental medicine. From his mother's side, maternal grandfather Giani Hazara Singh (1828‚Äì1908) was a renowned Sikh exegete who compiled a lexicon for the Guru Granth Sahib and translated Persian classics into Punjabi.  \n  Vir Singh received traditional education in Persian, Urdu, Sanskrit, and Sikh scriptures under Giani Harbhajan Singh and his grandfather. He attended Church Mission School in Amritsar, matriculating in 1891 and topping his district. The conversion of classmates to Christianity strengthened his Sikh convictions, inspiring him to use literature for religious education. At 17, he married Chatar Kaur, daughter of Sardar Narain Singh, and had two daughters."

In 1894, he founded the Khalsa Tract Society to promote Sikh theology, history, and reforms via affordable Punjabi tracts. He edited the Punjabi weekly *Khalsa Samachar* from 1899, fostering community discourse. He co-founded the Chief Khalsa Diwan (1902), Sikh Educational Conference (1908), and Punjab and Sind Bank (1908). His efforts countered British persecution, Christian missionary activities, and Hindu assimilation, emphasizing Sikh distinctiveness through education and media. Vir Singh's press became a hub for Punjabi writers like Dhani Ram Chatrik."
