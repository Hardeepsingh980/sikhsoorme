      "value": "Kabir's birth and early years are shrouded in legend and scholarly debate. Commonly dated to around 1440 CE in Varanasi (Kashi), Uttar Pradesh, he was reportedly found as an infant on a lotus flower in Lahartara Pond by a Muslim weaver named Niru and his wife Nima, who adopted and raised him as their own [SikhiWiki; Wikipedia]. Some traditions claim a divine incarnation at Brahmamuhurta on the full moon of Jyeshtha month (Vikram Samvat 1455). Born into a low-caste Julaha (weaver) family, Kabir grew up in the Kabir Chaura locality of Varanasi, a center of Brahmanical orthodoxy in 15th-century India. As a youth, he apprenticed in weaving and became a disciple of the Vaishnava saint Ramananda around the early 1460s, receiving initiation through a clever ruse at the Panchganga Ghat. Kabir's upbringing blended Hindu and Muslim influences, fostering his syncretic worldview. He married Loi (or Mata Loi) and had two children: a son, Kamal, and a daughter, Kamali. Early life was marked by poverty and social marginalization, yet Kabir pursued spiritual inquiry amidst Varanasi's religious fervor [Wikipedia; Research Summary]."

      "value": "Kabir's primary contributions were through his poetry and teachings, which bridged religious divides and challenged societal norms. He composed thousands of verses (banis) orally, disseminated by disciples, critiquing hypocrisy in both Hinduism and Islam. As a wandering saint (sant), he gathered followers from diverse castes, including prostitutes and laborers, promoting egalitarian devotion. His inclusion of 778 compositions in the Guru Granth Sahib (compiled 1604 CE) underscores his influence on Sikhism, where he is honored as a Bhagat. Kabir founded the Kabir Panth, a sect emphasizing inner spirituality over rituals. He traveled extensively, preaching in Varanasi, Maghar, and surrounding regions, enduring persecution from orthodox leaders under Sultan Sikandar Lodi (r. 1489‚Äì1517). His service extended to social reform, advocating women's rights and interfaith harmony during a time of religious tension [SikhiWiki; Wikipedia]."

Examples appear on pages 91‚Äì92, 323‚Äì330, 1103‚Äì1106, etc. [SikhiWiki; Wikipedia]. His language blended Awadhi, Bhojpuri, and Persian, making it accessible to the masses."

Gurbani verses indicate he \"wasted\" his youth in Varanasi's fruitless rituals but found true enlightenment (Gurmat) in Maghar's saintly company. Persecuted by Sikandar Lodi, he faced trials by fire, water, and elephant trampling but emerged unscathed. Kabir passed away in 1518 CE in Maghar, where Hindus and Muslims vied for his funeral rites. A samadhi and mazar coexist at his memorial, reflecting his unifying legacy [SikhiWiki; Research Summary]."
