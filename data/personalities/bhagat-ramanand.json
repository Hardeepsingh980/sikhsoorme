      "value": "Ramanand was born into a Kanyakubja Brahmin family in Allahabad (Prayagraj) around the late 14th century (scholarly estimates range from 1296 to 1400 CE). From a young age, he showed spiritual inclination and pursued education in Hindu scriptures. He initially studied Advaita Vedanta under Adi Shankara's tradition before shifting to Vaishnava philosophy. At Varanasi (Benaras), he became a disciple of Raghavananda, a southern Vaishnava scholar influenced by Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita school. Raghavananda taught the Vatakalai (northern Rama-centric) branch of Sri Vaishnavism. However, a dispute arose over caste restrictions in spiritual practices‚ÄîRaghavananda limited initiation to upper castes, which Ramanand rejected, leading him to renounce his guru and embark on independent spiritual pursuits. This period marked his transition from orthodox Brahminical learning to a more inclusive devotional path."

      "value": "Ramanand spent much of his life in Varanasi, preaching Bhakti (devotional love) in accessible Hindi, making spiritual knowledge available to the masses beyond Sanskrit elites. He founded the Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest Vaishnava monastic order emphasizing celibacy, physical discipline, and devotion to Rama. As a social reformer, he broke caste barriers by initiating disciples from diverse backgrounds, including low-caste individuals like Kabir (a weaver) and Ravidas (a cobbler), women, and Muslims‚Äî a revolutionary act in caste-rigid medieval India. His teachings bridged southern Bhakti traditions with northern developments, influencing the broader Bhakti movement under Islamic rule. In Sikh context, his inclusion in the Guru Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan Dev Ji underscores his alignment with Sikh emphasis on equality and formless worship."

His authentic works include:  \n- One shabad (hymn) in the Guru Granth Sahib (Raag Basant, page 1195), emphasizing inner Guru realization and nirguna worship.  \n- Attributed Hindi texts: *Gyan-Lila* (on knowledge and devotion) and *Yog-Cintamani* (on yoga and contemplation).  \n- Sanskrit works: *Vaishnava Matabja Bhaskara* (on Vaishnava doctrine), *Ramarchana Paddhati* (rituals for Rama worship), *Brahma Sutra Anandbhashya*, *Upanishad Anandbhashya*, and *Shrimad Bhagavad Gita Anandbhashya*.  \nManuscripts from Sikh sources and Nagari-Pracarini Sabha confirm his nirguna (attributeless God) themes, aligning with Sikh philosophy. A shabad in the Sarbangi Granth (Dadupanthis) is also linked to him."

He passed away in Varanasi around the mid-15th century (estimates 1450‚Äì1467 CE), leaving a legacy through his disciples and sampradaya. Hagiographies describe his death as a peaceful merger with the divine, though exact details are legendary."
