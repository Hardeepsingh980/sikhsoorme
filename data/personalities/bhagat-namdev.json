Known for his devotional hymns (abhangas and bhajans) emphasizing bhakti (devotion) to the formless God, his works reflect themes of unity, rejection of idolatry, and spiritual equality. Sixty-one of his hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib, making him one of the 15 Bhagats honored in Sikh scripture.",

      "value": "Bhagat Namdev was born around October 29, 1270, in Narasi (present-day Narsi Namdev), a village near Pandharpur in Maharashtra, to Damashet (a calico printer/tailor) and Gonai (a devout woman). Legends describe his birth as a divine answer to his parents' prayers to Lord Vithoba (Vitthala), with some hagiographies claiming he was found floating in a river as an infant. Raised in a humble Chhimba household, Namdev assisted in his family's trade from a young age, dyeing and printing cloth‚Äîa profession that symbolized humility in his later teachings. By childhood, he showed spiritual inclinations, including a reported miracle where an idol of Vitthal drank milk offered by him. Influenced by the Bhakti Movement, he was drawn to devotion under saints like Jnaneshwar (Dnyaneshwar), rejecting ritualistic Hinduism for personal bhakti. Married before age 11 to Rajai (daughter of Govinda Sheti), he embraced grihastha (householder) life, fathering four sons (including Vitha, a writer) and one daughter. His maidservant, Janabai, became a noted poetess documenting his life. Early writings show saguna (form-worship) devotion to Vithoba, evolving to nirguna (formless) Absolute. Historical records are sparse, with first mentions in Mahanubhava texts like Leela Charitra (1278 CE), confirming his existence amid medieval India's social upheavals under Yadav and Delhi Sultanate rule.

      "value": "Namdev's primary contribution was revitalizing bhakti through accessible Marathi poetry, making spirituality available to the masses beyond Sanskrit elites. As a Varkari pilgrim, he undertook biannual yatras to Pandharpur, promoting communal kirtan (devotional singing) and equality across castes. He traveled extensively‚Äîto northern India, possibly Punjab (staying 20+ years in Ghuman, Gurdaspur)‚Äîspreading anti-caste, monotheistic messages. In Punjab, he influenced Sikhism's founders; his hymns were later compiled in the Guru Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan Dev (1604 CE), affirming Sikh bhakti roots. He rejected idol worship in later life, emphasizing nama-simran (remembrance of God's name) as the path to salvation. Socially, he advocated householder life over asceticism, unity of all faiths, and women's spiritual roles (via Janabai). Miracles attributed include the Aundha Nagnath Temple rotating 180 degrees to face him during kirtan (when priests barred entry due to caste) and surviving execution by a drunken elephant ordered by a skeptical king. His abhangas bridged Maharashtra's Varkari sampradaya with northern Sant traditions like Kabir Panth.

Key works include praises of Ram as nirguna Brahman and critiques of materialism. His style: Simple, rhythmic for kirtan; used everyday metaphors (e.g., shopkeeper as God). Full bani spans Guru Granth Sahib pages 345, 485-486, 525, etc. (up to 1351). No independent granth survives fully, but influences Dadu Panth and Kabir Panth texts.

Post-death, followers built memorials: Namdev Gate at Pandharpur Temple; Gurdwara Tapiana Sahib in Ghuman. His legacy endured via oral traditions and Varkari pilgrimages.
