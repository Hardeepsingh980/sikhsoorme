      "value": "Bhai Mati Das was born into a Mohyal Brahmin family of the Chhibber clan in the village of Karyala, near Chakwal in the Jhelum District (now in Pakistan). His grandfather, Bhai Praga, was a devoted Sikh who fought alongside Guru Hargobind in early Sikh-Mughal conflicts and attained martyrdom. His father, Hira Nand, was a warrior-disciple under Guru Hargobind and participated in several battles before entrusting his sons, Mati Das and Sati Das, to the care of Guru Har Rai shortly before his death. From a young age, Bhai Mati Das served in the Guru's household, performing menial tasks and imbibing Sikh principles of equality, devotion, and courage. He and his brother accompanied Guru Har Krishan to Delhi during the emperor's summons, demonstrating early loyalty amid political tensions under Mughal rule."

      "value": "Bhai Mati Das served as the Diwan (chief financial officer) for Guru Tegh Bahadur, managing the Guru's resources and administration after the Guru's ascension in 1664. He accompanied the Guru on extensive preaching tours across eastern India, including Assam, from 1665 to 1670. During these journeys, he assisted in establishing Sikh centers and providing aid to communities facing famine and Mughal oppression. In 1670, after Guru Tegh Bahadur founded Anandpur Sahib (then Chakk Nanaki), Bhai Mati Das helped in its development as a Sikh stronghold. His role extended to diplomatic and logistical support, ensuring the Guru's message of religious freedom reached persecuted groups, particularly Kashmiri Pandits threatened with forced conversion to Islam by Emperor Aurangzeb. Cross-verified from SikhiWiki and Wikipedia: He was imprisoned briefly in 1665 at Dhamtan due to local opposition but was released through intervention."

Despite torture, Bhai Mati Das refused to renounce Sikhism, leading to his execution on November 9, 1675 (two days before the Guru's martyrdom)."
