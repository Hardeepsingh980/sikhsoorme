He was born into a family of Brahmin bards known as the \"Bhatts,\" who were traditional poets and scribes in northern India. As the son of Bhatt Bhika, he grew up in an environment steeped in Sanskrit learning and Hindu mythological knowledge. His brothers, Bhatt Mathura and Bhatt Kirat, were also part of this poetic lineage. Jalap likely received education in classical Indian literature, which influenced his poetic style. He became associated with the Sikh Gurus during the mid-16th century, drawn to the spiritual teachings of Guru Amar Das (third Sikh Guru, r. 1552‚Äì1574). Historical chronicles suggest he traveled to Goindval, where Guru Amar Das resided, seeking spiritual refuge and becoming a devoted follower."

He was particularly devoted to Guru Amar Das, whom he praised as the \"Father of the World\" and a embodiment of divine grace. Jalap's role extended to being a scribe, assisting in the documentation of Sikh scriptures. His five swaiyas (metrical hymns) were selected by Guru Arjan (fifth Sikh Guru, r. 1581‚Äì1606) for inclusion in the Adi Granth, the precursor to the Guru Granth Sahib. These hymns emphasize themes of devotion, liberation from worldly cycles, and the supremacy of the Guru's guidance. He witnessed and recorded key events in Sikh history, contributing to the oral and written preservation of Gurbani."
