      "value": "Arjan Singh was born on April 15, 1919, in Lyallpur (now Faisalabad, Pakistan), into a Punjabi Jat Sikh family of the Aulakh clan. His family had a strong military tradition spanning four generations in the British Indian Army. His great-grandfather, Naib Risaldar Sultana Singh, enlisted in 1854 and was martyred in 1879 during the Afghan campaign. His grandfather, Risaldar Major Hukam Singh, served from 1883 to 1917, and his father retired as a Risaldar in the cavalry. Singh was the first in his family to become a commissioned officer. Educated in Montgomery (now Sahiwal) and Government College Lahore, he excelled in sports, captaining the swimming team and setting multiple Punjab and university records. In 1938, he entered the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, graduating in December 1939 as a Pilot Officer, topping the Empire Pilot training course."

He flew over 60 types of aircraft, logging thousands of hours, and led 1,000+ sorties during the Siege of Imphal (1944), earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for gallantry. Post-independence, he commanded the first fly-past over the Red Fort in 1947 and led Air Force Station Ambala as Group Captain. Promoted to Air Commodore in 1950, he commanded the Operational Group (covering all air operations in India) for two extended stints (1950‚Äì1952 and 1955‚Äì1959). As Air Vice Marshal, he oversaw modernization, including supersonic fighters and radar networks. Appointed Chief of Air Staff in 1964 at age 45, he led the IAF through the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, achieving air superiority and preventing enemy advances in Chhamb. His leadership ensured deep strikes on Pakistani airfields like Peshawar. Post-retirement, he served in diplomacy and governance, enhancing India's international relations."
