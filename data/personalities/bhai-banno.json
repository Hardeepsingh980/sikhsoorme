      "value": "Bhai Banno was born into a devout family in the village of Mangat, also referred to as Khara Mangat, in the Phalia tahsil of Gujrat district (now in Pakistan). His father, Bhai Bishan Dev, instilled in him a strong religious disposition from an early age. Growing up in the Punjab region during the 16th century, Bhai Banno imbibed Sikh values and became a committed Sikh under the spiritual guidance of the early Gurus. Historical accounts describe him as diligent and pious, traits that defined his lifelong service to the Sikh community [SikhiWiki Reference]."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",

      "value": "Bhai Banno's most significant contributions occurred during the era of Guru Arjan Dev. He rendered dedicated service during the construction of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar, contributing to its physical and spiritual development. In 1604, following the compilation of the Adi Granth (the precursor to the Guru Granth Sahib), Guru Arjan entrusted Bhai Banno with the sacred duty of transporting the original manuscript to Lahore for professional binding. With the Guru's permission, he first took it to his village, where he meticulously prepared an exact copy of the Granth. He then proceeded to Lahore, had both volumes bound, and returned them to the Guru. The original Adi Bir was installed in the Harmandir Sahib, while Bhai Banno received his copy, which became known as the \"Bhai Banno Vali Bir\" or \"Khare Vali Bir.\" He installed this copy in his family home in Khara Mangat, making it a center for Sikh worship and learning. Throughout his life, Bhai Banno preached Sikh tenets across the northwestern Punjab, fostering the growth of the faith in rural areas [Cross-verified from SikhiWiki and historical texts; Wikipedia mentions in broader Sikh history pages, no dedicated article]."

The Bhai Banno Vali Bir, while a copy, includes some debated additions (e.g., certain raags or hymns not in the standard Kartarpuri Bir), but these are considered later interpolations rather than his original work. Scholars note that his copy served as an early reference text for Sikh communities [Citation needed for specific interpolations; referenced in Sikh historical studies]."

He passed away in January 1645 (Magh 1701 Bikrami) at the age of approximately 87, leaving a legacy of scriptural preservation. His family home in Khara Mangat remained a site of reverence for the installed Bir until historical upheavals, including the Partition of India [SikhiWiki; cross-checked with Bhai Banno Darpan by Rajinder Singh Bal]."
