      "value": "Bibi Roop Kaur was born around the 1640s to Guru Har Rai and Mata Krishan Kaur (also known as Sulakhni or Kishan Devi) in Kiratpur Sahib. Her father ascended to Guruship at age 14 in 1644, following the death of his grandfather, Guru Hargobind. Raised in the Sodhi Khatri household amid the Guru's emphasis on environmental sensitivity, herbal medicine, and maintaining a Sikh army for protection rather than aggression, Roop Kaur grew up in a nurturing yet vigilant environment. As the only daughter among sons Ram Rai and Har Krishan (the latter becoming the 8th Guru), she was immersed in Sikh spiritual practices from childhood. Historical accounts are sparse, but Sikh tradition portrays her as deeply devoted to recitation of Gurbani and service (seva) in the langar and community gatherings. The social conditions of the time were marked by Mughal expansion under Shah Jahan and later Aurangzeb, with intermittent tensions for the Sikh community, influencing her upbringing in resilience and faith."
