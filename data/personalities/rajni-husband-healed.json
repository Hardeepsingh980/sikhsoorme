      "value": "Bibi Rajni was the youngest of seven daughters born to Rai Duni Chand, a wealthy revenue collector (kardar) in the town of Patti, Punjab, during the late 16th century. Raised in a prosperous household, Rajni displayed profound piety from a young age. Unlike her sisters, who attributed material gifts to their father's generosity, Rajni believed all blessings came from God, viewing her father as merely an instrument of divine will. This belief often clashed with her father's expectations, leading to tensions. Her devotion to Sikh teachings, even before formal initiation, marked her as a true Gurmukh (one aligned with the Guru's wisdom). Historical context places her life amid the expanding Sikh community under Guru Amar Das and Guru Ram Das, a time of spiritual revival against Mughal influences."

      "value": "After her father, angered by her piety, arranged her marriage to a severely disfigured leper as punishment, Bibi Rajni embraced her fate without complaint. She cared for her husband, Bhai Mohan, with unwavering love and dedication‚Äîbathing him, feeding him, and performing Naam Simran (meditation on God's name) despite begging for their livelihood. This selfless service (seva) exemplified Sikh ideals of equality and devotion beyond social norms. Her story contributed to the sanctity of the site where her husband was healed, leading to the excavation of the Amrit Sarovar by Guru Ram Das. This pool's medicinal properties, attributed to surrounding Tulsi (basil) plants, became central to the establishment of Amritsar as a Sikh spiritual hub. Bibi Rajni's endurance promoted the message that true partnership in marriage reflects devotion to the Divine Husband (God), as echoed in Gurbani."

In a twist of fate, her father Rai Duni Chand suffered business losses and lived his final days in poverty with his daughter, awakening to the power of faith (as per related Sakhi of Duni Chand). She passed away in Amritsar, her legacy enduring through the sacred site her devotion helped reveal."
