      "value": "Bhai Kanhaiya was born in 1648 into a wealthy Dhamman Khatri trading family in Sodhra village, Sialkot (now Pakistan). His father, Bhai Narain Das (or Sri Nathu Ram), was a prosperous broker, and his mother was Mata Sundari. From childhood, Kanhaiya exhibited profound compassion, giving coins to the poor and helping laborers carry heavy loads. This early altruism foreshadowed his lifelong commitment to seva. After his father's death, he managed the family business but was deeply influenced by Bhai Nanua Bairagi, a devotee of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Nanua's recitation of Gurbani, including shabads on impermanence and universal brotherhood, awakened Kanhaiya's spiritual quest. He sought initiation from Guru Tegh Bahadur, becoming a Sikh and serving as the Guru's water carrier, langar assistant, and stable hand for the Guru's horses. Guru Tegh Bahadur blessed him, foreseeing a future of broad humanitarian service."

      "value": "Kanhaiya's service epitomized Sikh ideals of vand chakna (sharing) and dasvandh (tithing). In Anandpur Sahib during 1704-1705, amid sieges by Mughal-Rajput forces, he carried a mashak (goatskin water pouch) to quench the thirst of dying soldiers, offering langar-like aid without distinction between Sikhs, Hindus, or Mughals. When criticized by fellow Sikhs for aiding enemies, Guru Gobind Singh summoned him. Kanhaiya's response‚Äî\"I saw no Mughals or Sikhs, only Your children, O Guru\"‚Äîreflected Gurbani's teachings on equality (e.g., SGGS 1299: \"No one is my enemy, and no one is a stranger\"). Impressed, the Guru provided ointments and bandages, tasking him with expanded medical seva. Kanhaiya established a dharmshala in Kavha (Attock district, Pakistan) as a preaching and aid center. Guru Gobind Singh instructed him to propagate Sikhism in Sindh, where he became known as \"Khat Waro Bao\" (Bed-Seated Preacher). He founded the Sevapanthi order, emphasizing nishkam seva, simran (meditation), and interfaith harmony. His efforts included free dispensaries, education, and langar for the needy."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bhai Kanhaiya institutionalized non-discriminatory seva, challenging wartime biases and promoting Sikh values of daya (compassion), nimrata (humility), and pyar (love). He reformed aid by treating all humans as equals, predating the Geneva Conventions. In Sindh, he adapted preaching to local customs, using a bed (khat) for discourses to foster unity. His model influenced Sikh responses to disasters, as seen in modern efforts like UNITED SIKHS' \"Ghanaia\" aid post-2004 tsunami, providing langar and medical help impartially. He also promoted self-sufficiency in seva institutions through rope-making trades to avoid dependency on donations."

Succeeded by Bhai Sewa Ram, his legacy endured through the order.
