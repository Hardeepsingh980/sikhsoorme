      "value": "Bibi Bhani was born on January 19, 1535 (21 Magh 1591 Bikrami), in Basarke Gillan village near Amritsar, to Guru Amar Das and Mata Mansa Devi. She was the youngest daughter, with an elder sister Bibi Dani and two brothers, Bhai Mohan and Bhai Mohri. Growing up in a devout Sikh household during the formative years of the Sikh faith under her father's guidance, Bibi Bhani was immersed in the principles of equality, service, and devotion from a young age. Her early life was marked by close association with the Sikh sangat (community) at Basarke and later at Goindval, where her father established a major Sikh center. She exhibited exceptional piety and humility, traits that defined her lifelong commitment to seva (selfless service)."

    {
      "label": "Contributions/Service",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bibi Bhani's life was defined by unwavering service to her family and the Sikh community. She devotedly served her father, Guru Amar Das, even after marriage, assisting in daily routines such as bathing and ensuring his meditation was undisturbed. A legendary anecdote recounts her holding up a breaking leg of her father's meditation stool with her bare hand, sustaining injury to prevent disturbance, which led Guru Amar Das to bless her lineage with guruship.  \n  Married to Bhai Jetha (Guru Ram Das) in 1554, she supported his seva in constructing the Baoli Sahib at Goindval and the founding of Ramdaspur (later Amritsar). During Emperor Akbar's visit, she indirectly facilitated the grant of jagir lands (used for Amritsar's development) by accepting it as a wedding gift when her father refused state patronage. As a leader in the Piri system‚Äîa network of 22 female missionaries established by Guru Amar Das‚Äîshe educated women on Sikh tenets, promoting gender inclusivity in spiritual dissemination. She also mediated family disputes, supporting her son Guru Arjan Dev against his elder brother Prithi Chand's ambitions."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bibi Bhani influenced the transition to hereditary guruship within the Sikh tradition, convincing Guru Amar Das to select successors based on merit from within the family line, ensuring continuity while upholding spiritual qualifications. This reform stabilized the guruship amid growing Mughal pressures. She exemplified women's roles in Sikh reforms by challenging Punjabi superstitions that daughters should not serve fathers post-marriage, promoting equality in familial and spiritual duties. Her involvement in the Langar (community kitchen) and Piri system advanced social reforms like caste abolition and women's education."

She advised Arjan on community matters, including remarriage after his first wife's death, and helped thwart Prithi Chand's attempts to undermine the guruship. She passed away on April 9, 1598, in Goindval, leaving a legacy of quiet strength. Her death occurred during a period of consolidation for the Sikh faith under Guru Arjan's leadership."
