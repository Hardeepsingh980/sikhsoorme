      "value": "Bhai Sati Das was born into a prominent Chhibber clan family of Saraswat Mohyal Brahmins in the village of Karyala, located about 10 km from Chakwal on the road to the Katas Raj Temple Complex in the Jhelum District (then part of Punjab under Mughal rule, now in Pakistan). The region, known as *Dhani* (rich lands), was near salt and coal mines, with scenic features like the Katas Lake. His father, Hira Nand, was a devoted disciple of Guru Hargobind (Sixth Guru) and had fought in battles against Mughal forces as a grandson of Bhai Praga (or Paraga), an early Sikh convert. Hira Nand's brother, Dargah Mall, served as Diwan (household manager) to Gurus Har Rai and Har Krishan. Raised in this Sikh-influenced Brahmin household during a time of escalating Mughal-Sikh tensions, Bhai Sati Das embraced Sikhism early, imbibing values of devotion, equality, and resistance to tyranny. Little is documented about his youth, but his family's military and administrative ties to the Gurus shaped his lifelong commitment (citation: SikhiWiki; Harbans Singh, *Guru Tegh Bahadur*, 1982)."

      "value": "Bhai Sati Das served Guru Tegh Bahadur with exemplary dedication starting from the Guru's early days at Bakala (before ascension in 1664). Following Guru Har Krishan's passing, he and his brother Bhai Mati Das were among those seeking the new Guru, present when Makhan Shah Lobana discovered him. Appointed as a sewadar in the Guru's langar (community kitchen), Bhai Sati Das handled cooking duties, embodying Sikh principles of selfless service (seva). He accompanied the Guru on extensive eastern tours from 1665‚Äì1670, including stops at Saifabad, Dhamtan (Bangar), Dhaka, and Malda, where he assisted during arrests by local authorities influenced by rivals like Dhir Mal or orthodox elements. During these journeys, he helped establish Anandpur Sahib (then Chakk Nanaki) by purchasing land near Kiratpur. Notably, Bhai Sati Das was proficient in Persian and reportedly taught the language to the young Gobind Rai (future Guru Gobind Singh), aiding the Guru's court in Mughal-dominated regions. His financial and logistical support complemented his brother Diwan Mati Das's role in managing the Guru's household, strengthening the Sikh community's resilience amid persecution (citation: Bhatt Vahis Talauda; Piara Singh Padam, *Guru kian Sakhian*, 1986)."

      "value": "In 1675, amid Aurangzeb's aggressive policy of forced conversions targeting Hindus and Sikhs, Guru Tegh Bahadur resolved to sacrifice himself to protect Kashmiri Pandits and uphold dharma. Bhai Sati Das, along with Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dayala, Bhai Uda, and Bhai Jaita, formed the Guru's close entourage during the journey from Anandpur to Delhi. Arrested near Ropar at Malikpur Rangharan, they were transported in an iron cage to Sirhind and then Delhi. Imprisoned and tortured at the Red Fort, Bhai Sati Das refused to renounce Sikhism despite interrogations by the Qazi on religious differences between Hinduism, Sikhism, and Islam. On November 24, 1675, at Chandni Chowk's kotwali (police station), he was executed in the Guru's sight: wrapped in cotton wool soaked in oil, set ablaze, and burned alive while reciting Sikh prayers. This followed his brother Mati Das's sawing martyrdom and preceded Bhai Dayala's boiling. The Guru praised his resolve before his own execution on December 11, 1675 (citation: Wikipedia; Garja Singh, *Shahid Bilas*, 1961 ‚Äì dates cross-verified, noting minor discrepancies between November 11 and 24; SikhiWiki aligns with 24th)."

    "politicalSituation": "Aurangzeb's expansionist rule intensified persecution of non-Muslims, especially after reimposing jizya in 1679. Sikhs, viewed as rebels due to Guru Hargobind's militarization, faced arrests. The 1675 summons to Delhi targeted Guru Tegh Bahadur for his growing influence and defense of Kashmiri Pandits against conversion threats.",
    "socialConditions": "Widespread religious intolerance; Hindus and Sikhs endured executions, temple destructions, and economic pressures. The Chhibber Brahmins, like Bhai Sati Das's family, bridged Hindu-Sikh worlds but adopted Sikh egalitarianism, rejecting caste in favor of devotion amid rural Punjab's feudal-Mughal tensions.",
    "significance": "The martyrdoms of Bhai Sati Das and companions galvanized Sikh identity, portraying Guru Tegh Bahadur as *Hind di Chadar* (Shield of India). This event, in the broader context of Sikh-Mughal conflicts, paved the way for the Khalsa's militarized response, influencing India's history of religious pluralism (citation: Hari Ram Gupta, *History of the Sikhs*, 1978)."
