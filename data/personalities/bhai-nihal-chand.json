      "value": "Detailed information on Bhai Nihal Chand's early life is scarce in historical records. He is believed to have been born in Punjab during the mid-to-late 17th century, in a family of devout Sikhs. As a young man, he was drawn to the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and joined the Khalsa Panth, the warrior-saint community established by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. His early years likely involved training in martial arts and devotion at Sikh shrines, preparing him for service in the Guru's court at Anandpur Sahib. Limited sources suggest he hailed from a Jat or agricultural background, common among Sikh warriors of the time. (citationNeeded: Specific birth details unverified across sources)"

      "value": "Bhai Nihal Chand's primary role was as the armor bearer (shastar-badhak) to Guru Gobind Singh, a position of great trust involving the maintenance and readiness of the Guru's weapons, including swords, shields, and armor. He accompanied the Guru during travels and battles, ensuring protection during conflicts with hill rajas and Mughal forces. Notable service includes his presence at the Battles of Anandpur (1680s-1704), where he supported the Sikh forces against superior numbers. His dedication exemplified the Sikh principle of miri-piri (temporal and spiritual authority). He is also mentioned in oral traditions as aiding in the evacuation and protection during the siege of Anandpur Sahib in 1704. Without direct written records from the Guru Granth Sahib, his service is documented in later Sikh janamsakhis and historical accounts by scholars like Sohan Singh Seetal."
