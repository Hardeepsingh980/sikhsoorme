      "value": "Baba Gurditta was born in 1613 (or possibly 1608 per some historical accounts) in the forested village of Daroli Bhai in the Malwa region of Punjab to Guru Hargobind and Mata Damodari (SikhiWiki infobox notes Mata Ganga, but textual sources confirm Damodari as the mother of Guru Hargobind's elder sons). His birth was celebrated with the distribution of sacred prasad, as recorded in contemporary accounts. From a young age, he received training in religious lore, Sikh scriptures, and martial arts under his father's guidance, reflecting the era's emphasis on a balanced spiritual and warrior ethos. He resembled Guru Nanak in appearance, earning his name \"Gurditta\" (Gur + ditta, meaning \"form given by the Guru\"). At around age 6 (1619), he was engaged to Ananti (Netti), daughter of Bhai Rama of Batala, with the marriage solemnized on 17 April 1621 in a grand ceremony attended by Sikh congregations from regions like Darauli, Mandiali, Goindval, and Khadur Sahib. Guru Hargobind gifted him a horse valued at 100,000 rupees. Baba Buddha and Bhai Gurdas remained in Amritsar to oversee key Gurdwaras during the event."

      "value": "Baba Gurditta played a crucial role in expanding Sikh institutions and missionary work. In 1626‚Äì1627, he resided in Kartarpur (Jalandhar district) as per his father's directives, helping organize Sikh communities. He founded the township of Kiratpur Sahib around 1627‚Äì1634 (sources vary) near the Shivalik foothills, purchasing land from Raja Tara Chand of Kehlur. This settlement became a major Sikh center, serving as residence for Gurus Hargobind, Har Rai, and Har Krishan. Appointed by Baba Sri Chand (son of Guru Nanak) as successor to head the Udasi sect, he invigorated its activities by establishing four preaching centers (dh≈´ƒÅ·πÖs) to propagate Sikh teachings. He also participated in defensive Sikh operations, commanding forces alongside Baba Bidhi Chand during sieges."

      "value": "In his later years, Baba Gurditta resided primarily in Kiratpur Sahib. He took part in the Battle of Kartarpur in 1635 against Painde Khan and Mughal forces, where he slew Asman Khan (a childhood friend) with an arrow, later weeping over the death and remarking on the tragedy of circumstance forcing fratricide. An incident with a proposed second marriage to Nakhora's daughter was vetoed by Guru Hargobind after protests from Mata Ananti. On 15 March 1638, while hunting, he accidentally killed a cow (mistaking it for a deer) and reluctantly revived it through a miracle at the urging of his party. Admonished by Guru Hargobind for displaying such powers (contrary to Sikh humility), he retreated in remorse to a lonely spot outside Kiratpur and passed away at age 24‚Äì25. His funeral involved honors for martyred Nihangs at Killi Sahib Gurdwara."
