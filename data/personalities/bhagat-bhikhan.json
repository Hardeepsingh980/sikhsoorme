      "value": "Bhagat Bhikhan was born around 1480 in Kakori, near Lucknow, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India. Sources conflict on his religious background: some describe him as born into a Hindu family within the Ramanandi Sampradaya tradition (a Vaishnava sect), influenced by saints like Bhagat Ravidas and Bhagat Dhanna. Others, including historical accounts from Mughal chronicler Badauni, portray him as a Muslim Sufi with an Islamic upbringing, a learned scholar who memorized the Quran and studied Dharmashastras. He lived as a married householder, leading a simple life of piety and teaching. Confusion arises from two contemporary figures sharing the name: a Hindu saint and Sheikh Bhikhan, the Sufi of Kakori. Historians like Max Arthur MacAuliffe and Harbans Singh note his devotion to spiritual teachings, possibly as a disciple of Mir Sayyed Ibrahim or influenced by Kabir.

He emphasized the Naam (Divine Name) as the cure for all worldly ills, bridging Hindu Bhakti and Islamic Sufi traditions. His role as a guide influenced local communities, promoting piety, wisdom, and virtue. He left behind children known for their spiritual qualities. Bhikhan's hymns were selected by Guru Arjan Dev for inclusion in the Guru Granth Sahib, highlighting Sikhism's inclusive approach to saintly compositions.
