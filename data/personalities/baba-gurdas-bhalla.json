      "value": "Bhai Gurdas was born in 1551 in Goindval, Punjab, into a Bhalla Khatri family. He was the only child of Bhai Ishar Das, the youngest brother of Guru Amar Das, and Mata Jivani. Orphaned at a young age‚Äîlosing his mother at three and father at twelve‚Äîhe was adopted by his uncle, Guru Amar Das. Under the Guru's patronage at Goindval and Sultanpur Lodhi, he received a comprehensive education in Sanskrit, Braj Bhasha, Persian, and Punjabi. He studied Hindu and Muslim literary traditions, including time spent in Varanasi learning scriptures. By his early twenties, Guru Ram Das appointed him as a missionary to Agra, marking the start of his lifelong dedication to preaching Guru Nanak's teachings."

      "value": "Bhai Gurdas contributed immensely to Sikh infrastructure and scripture. In 1577, he labored in excavating the Sarovar at Amritsar's Harmandir Sahib. He served as the primary scribe for the Adi Granth (1604), dictating under Guru Arjan over 19 years while supervising four other scribes (Bhai Haria, Bhai Sant Das, Bhai Sukha, and Bhai Manasa Ram). As the first Jathedar of the Akal Takht (appointed by Guru Hargobind in 1606), he helped construct the throne alongside Baba Buddha, managing its affairs during the Guru's imprisonment in Gwalior (1612). He led missionary expeditions to Kabul, Kashmir, Rajputana, Varanasi, and even Sri Lanka, reciting hymns to Emperor Akbar in 1597 to affirm their spiritual (non-sectarian) nature. He also educated young Guru Tegh Bahadur in classics."

As Jathedar, he reinforced the Akal Takht's authority as a seat of temporal Sikh power, blending miri-piri (temporal-spiritual) governance. His writings promoted ethical living, equality, and devotion, influencing Sikh thought without direct institutional reforms."

He also composed 672 Kabits and 3 Swayyas in Braj Bhasha, plus 6 Chhands of 8 verses each in Sanskrit. These works cover theology, history, ethics, and Sikh events, often recited in Gurdwaras. A 1939 discovery added 119 more Kabits. His poetry is vigorous, didactic, and reflective of Guru's teachings on monotheism, equality, and righteous living."
