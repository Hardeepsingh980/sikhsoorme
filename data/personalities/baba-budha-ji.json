      "value": "Baba Buddha was born on October 6, 1506, in the village of Katthu Nangal (also spelled Kathu Nangal), about 18 km northeast of present-day Amritsar, Punjab. He belonged to the Randhawa Jat clan, a farming community. His father, Sugha Randhawa, and mother, Mai Gauran (from the Sandhu family), named him Bura, meaning \"old man,\" perhaps foreshadowing his future wisdom. As a child, while grazing cattle near his village, he encountered Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, around 1521 when Guru Nanak was traveling through the region. Young Bura approached the Guru with a bowl of milk as an offering and posed deep philosophical questions about life, death, and the soul's cycle of rebirth. Impressed by the boy's maturity, Guru Nanak renamed him \"Buddha,\" signifying wisdom typically associated with age. This encounter marked the beginning of his lifelong devotion to Sikhism. By age 17, he married in Achal near Batala, but his focus remained on spiritual pursuits, leading him to spend more time at Kartarpur, Guru Nanak's base, than at home. Historical context: During this era, Punjab was under the influence of the Lodi Dynasty and later Babur's Mughal invasions (1526 onward), with social conditions marked by religious syncretism, caste rigidity, and spiritual seeking amid turmoil. Baba Buddha's Jat background placed him in a \"low-caste\" agrarian society, yet Guru Nanak's teachings emphasized equality, which profoundly shaped his life.

      "value": "Baba Buddha's service spanned over a century, making him a bridge between the foundational and institutional phases of Sikhism. He was among Guru Nanak's earliest disciples, assisting in daily tasks at Kartarpur. After Guru Nanak's passing in 1539, he anointed Guru Angad Dev Ji (formerly Bhai Lehna) with the tilak (ceremonial mark) of guruship, a role he repeated for Guru Amar Das (1552), Guru Ram Das (1574), Guru Arjan Dev (1581), and Guru Hargobind (1606)—an unprecedented honor that elevated his status despite his humble origins. Under Guru Amar Das, he helped construct the Baoli (stepwell) at Goindwal Sahib, a key Sikh pilgrimage site promoting community gathering. With Guru Ram Das and Guru Arjan, he supervised the excavation of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar) in 1577, which became the foundation of Amritsar city and the Harmandir Sahib. In 1604, Guru Arjan appointed him the first Granthi of the newly completed Harmandir Sahib, where he recited from the Adi Granth (early Guru Granth Sahib). He also administered a 500-bigha jagir (land grant) gifted to Bibi Bhani (daughter of Guru Amar Das) by Emperor Akbar, known as \"Beer Baba Buddha Ji,\" used for farming and education. Militarily, he learned Shastar Vidya (Sikh weaponry and combat) directly from Guru Nanak and trained recruits for Guru Hargobind's Akal Sena (later Budha Dal Nihang). Alongside Bhai Gurdas, he built the Akal Takht in 1606, symbolizing temporal authority (miri-piri). His teachings popularized Gurmukhi script, invented by Guru Angad. Baba Buddha's life exemplified seva (selfless service), langar (community kitchen), and simran (meditation), fostering Sikh organizational growth amid Mughal persecution.

      "value": "- Promotion of Equality: As a Jat farmer, his elevation to anoint Gurus challenged caste hierarchies, aligning with Sikh principles of egalitarianism (e.g., his role transcended social barriers).  - Institutional Foundations: Instrumental in establishing Amritsar as a Sikh center through sarovar excavation and gurdwara constructions, shifting Sikhism from itinerant to communal practice.  - Miri-Piri Doctrine: During Guru Hargobind's installation, he presented swords instead of the traditional seli (wool cord), symbolizing the balance of spiritual (piri) and temporal (miri) power, a pivotal reform for Sikh self-defense.  - Script and Education: Taught Gurmukhi to Sikh children, aiding literacy and preservation of Gurbani (Sikh scriptures).  - Military Training: Reformed the early Sikh army (Akal Sena) into a disciplined force, training in Shastar Vidya post-Guru Arjan's martyrdom (1606), preparing Sikhs for resistance against oppression. No major personal writings, but his oral teachings and ceremonies standardized Sikh rituals.

His family had moved to Ramdas (founded by his son Bhai Bhana). At age 124, he passed away on September 8, 1631, in Jhanda Ramdas on the Ravi River's banks. Guru Hargobind attended his bedside, carried his bier, and performed rites while a continuous Akhand Path (recitation) of the Adi Granth was initiated by Bhai Gurdas, concluding post-cremation. Guru Hargobind honored him by gifting a turban to Bhai Bhana. His samadhi (memorial) is at Gurdwara Baba Buddha Ji in Ramdas. This event underscored his enduring bond with the Gurus.
