      "value": "Bhai Himmat Singh was born on January 18, 1661, in Jagannath Puri (modern-day Odisha, India) into a Jhivar family, traditionally water carriers considered a \"low-caste\" occupation in the socio-economic structure of 17th-century India. His father was Gulzari (or Gulzaree), and his mother was Dhanno (or Dhanoo). Growing up in a humble household amid the diverse cultural landscape of eastern India, Himmat Rai (his pre-initiation name) likely experienced the hardships of caste-based discrimination and economic limitations. At the age of 17 (around 1678), he journeyed to Anandpur Sahib, the fortified center of Sikhism under Guru Gobind Singh, seeking spiritual fulfillment and service. There, he attached himself devotedly to the Guru, imbibing Sikh teachings on equality, courage, and resistance to tyranny. This period coincided with escalating Mughal persecution of non-Muslims and hill Rajas' intrigues, shaping his resolve as a warrior."

      "value": "Bhai Himmat Singh's pivotal contribution was during the historic Vaisakhi assembly on April 14, 1699, at Anandpur Sahib. As the third volunteer to respond to Guru Gobind Singh's call for five heads to forge the Khalsa‚Äîa saint-soldier order to combat oppression‚Äîhe demonstrated unparalleled himmat (courage). Renamed Himmat Singh upon baptism (Khanda di Pahul), he helped establish the Khalsa's core principles: equality across castes, martial readiness, and unwavering faith. In Anandpur, he trained in martial arts and participated in defensive battles against encroaching hill chiefs (Pahari Rajas) and Mughal imperial forces, defending Sikh ideals during a time of religious and political turmoil. His service underscored the Khalsa's role in protecting the vulnerable and upholding dharma."

      "value": "As a founding member of the Panj Pyare, Bhai Himmat Singh was instrumental in Guru Gobind Singh's reforms abolishing caste distinctions within Sikhism. The Khalsa initiation he underwent rejected hereditary castes (e.g., his own Jhivar background), promoting a uniform identity through the Five Ks (Kesh, Kangha, Kara, Kachera, Kirpan). This reform challenged Mughal-imposed social hierarchies and inspired a pan-Indian resistance movement. His act symbolized the shift from passive spirituality to active militancy, influencing Sikh governance and self-defense structures."

Bhai Himmat Singh fought valiantly in skirmishes around Anandpur. In December 1704 (or 1705 per some sources), he accompanied the Guru to the besieged fort of Chamkaur. Outnumbered by 10,000 Mughal troops, he attained shaheedi (martyrdom) on December 7 alongside fellow Panj Pyare members Bhai Sahib Singh and Bhai Mohkam Singh. His death at age 44 exemplified the Sikh ethos of fighting to the last breath, preserving the Guru's lineage and the Khalsa spirit."
