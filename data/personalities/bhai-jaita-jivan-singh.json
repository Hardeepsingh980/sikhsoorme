      "value": "Bhai Jaita was born on 13 December 1649 in Patna, Bihar, to Bhai Sada Nand and Mata Premo (also known as Kanno). His family, originally from Kathu Nangal near Amritsar, had deep ties to Sikh Gurus, serving from Guru Nanak to Guru Har Rai. As a child, Jaita played with young Gobind Rai (later Guru Gobind Singh) in Patna, where the family resided during Guru Tegh Bahadur's eastern tours. Trained in warfare, horse-riding, swimming, music, and Kirtan, he moved to Punjab around 1670, settling in Ramdas village with Bhai Gurditta, a descendant of Baba Buddha. In 1691, he married Bibi Raj Kaur, daughter of Sujan Singh from Riar near Amritsar, and had four sons. His early devotion led him to Anandpur Sahib, where he became the first drummer (nagarchi) of the Ranjit Nagara, the war drum symbolizing Sikh valor (SikhiWiki; Wikipedia)."

      "value": "Jaita's most legendary act occurred after Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom on 11 November 1675 in Delhi under Aurangzeb's orders. Disguised and aided by his uncle Bhai Agya Ram, Kotwal Khwaja Abdullah, and Aurangzeb's daughter Zebunnisa, he, along with Bhai Uday Singh and Bhai Nanu, recovered the Guru's severed head and body amid heavy guards and rain. To deceive the Mughals, Jaita beheaded his own father, Bhai Sada Nand, and swapped the remains, cremating Guru Tegh Bahadur's body at Bhai Agya Ram's home in Raisinha (later Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib). He then carried the head 800 km to Anandpur Sahib, arriving on 15 November 1675, where young Gobind Rai honored him with the title \"Rangreta Guru Ka Beta.\" Jaita served as Guru Gobind Singh's chief drummer, intelligence head, and military tutor to Sahibzadas Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh. He fought in 15 battles, including Bhangani (1688), Nadaun (1691), Bajrur (1694), Nirmohgarh (1694), four sieges of Anandpur (1700‚Äì1704), Bansali/Kalmot (1704), Sarsa (1704), and Chamkaur (1704), often using dual rifles (Nagni and Baghni) and swords simultaneously in guerrilla tactics (SikhiWiki; *Sri Gur Katha* excerpts)."

His story inspired the inclusion of Mazhabi Sikhs in the Panth, countering social discrimination. He contributed to preserving Guru Tegh Bahadur's verses (in Raag Jaijaivanti) in the Guru Granth Sahib during its compilation at Damdama Sahib, ensuring they were not lost post-martyrdom (citationNeeded: Direct link to Bhai Mani Singh's role).

The work includes eyewitness accounts of Guru Tegh Bahadur's martyrdom and his father's sacrifice (page 35).

In the Second Battle of Chamkaur (21‚Äì23 December 1704), with only 40 Sikhs against 10 lakh Mughals, he was among the last defenders. The surviving Sikhs, including the Panj Pyare, commanded the Guru to escape; Jiwan Singh was chosen to disguise as the Guru, donning his plume (kalgi), attire, and weapons to deceive the enemy. He fought valiantly from the fort's tower, beating the Ranjit Nagara and firing arrows/guns until ammunition ran out. Emerging with dual swords, he slew many foes before being martyred by arrows and bullets on 23 December 1704. His body was cremated by Mata Sharan Kaur at the site of Gurdwara Shaheed Burj Sahib (SikhiWiki; Wikipedia)."
