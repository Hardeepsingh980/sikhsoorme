      "value": "Piara Singh Gill was born on October 28, 1911, in the village of Chela in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, British India, into a Sikh Gill Jat family. He received his early education at Khalsa High School in Mahilpur, completing his matriculation in 1928. Demonstrating early academic promise, Gill left for the United States in 1929. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Southern California. Pursuing advanced studies, he joined the University of Chicago, where he worked under the renowned physicist Arthur Compton, a Nobel laureate. Gill completed his PhD in Physics in March 1940, focusing on cosmic ray research. His early exposure to cutting-edge science in America shaped his career, and he maintained lifelong friendships with key figures like Homi J. Bhabha and J. Robert Oppenheimer.

He returned to India in 1940 and lectured in Physics at Forman Christian College, Lahore, until 1947. In 1947, Bhabha appointed him as a Research Professorship Fellow at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Bombay. Impressed by his expertise, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru appointed him Officer-on-Special Duty (OSD) with the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948. Gill served as Professor and Head of the Department of Physics at Aligarh Muslim University (1949‚Äì1963), where he also acted as Dean of the Faculty of Science (1950‚Äì1953 and 1956‚Äì1958). He directed the Gulmarg Research Observatory (1951‚Äì1971), focusing on cosmic ray studies at high altitudes. In 1963, Nehru tasked him with establishing and directing the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) in Chandigarh until 1971, transforming it into a leading Asian center for scientific instrument design. Post-retirement, he was Professor Emeritus at Punjab Agricultural University (1972‚Äì1982) and Adjunct Professor at Georgia Institute of Technology (1990‚Äì1994). Gill advised Nehru on India's nuclear weapons strategy during the 1950s‚Äì1960s and contributed to the Manhattan Project during his U.S. tenure. He also founded Universal Magnetics (P) Ltd. and served as Honorary Scientific Adviser to the Government of Punjab. [Source: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki; citationNeeded for Manhattan Project details]"
