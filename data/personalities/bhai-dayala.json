      "value": "Bhai Dayala was born into a devout Saraswat Mohyal Brahmin family of the Chhibber clan, though exact details of his birth date and place remain undocumented in historical records. He emerged as a prominent Sikh adherent during the guruship of Guru Har Krishan (1661‚Äì1664). In 1664, as a young devoted Sikh, Bhai Dayala was among the approximately 25 Sikhs, including Mata Sulakhni (Mata Kishan), who accompanied the young Guru Har Krishan from Kiratpur Sahib to Delhi to meet Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This journey highlighted his early commitment to the Sikh faith amid growing Mughal scrutiny of non-Islamic religions. Historical accounts suggest he was influenced by the martial and spiritual legacy of earlier Sikh warriors, possibly through familial ties to disciples of Guru Hargobind."

He was appointed chief of the Sikh congregation (sangat) at Patna Sahib and oversaw the masands (Sikh representatives) across eastern India. A notable contribution was his role in communicating the birth of Guru Tegh Bahadur's son, Gobind Rai (later Guru Gobind Singh), born on December 22, 1666, in Patna. From Dacca (modern-day Dhaka), where the Guru was traveling, Bhai Dayala dispatched a letter informing him of this joyous event. He assisted in caring for the young Gobind Rai alongside Bhai Kirpal Chand during the Guru's absences. By 1672, he rejoined the Guru's family at Lakhnaur Sahib en route from Patna to Baba Bakala. In 1675, he accompanied Guru Tegh Bahadur from Anandpur Sahib toward Delhi, alongside brothers Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das, in a mission to defend religious freedoms against Mughal forced conversions."

The group was arrested en route at Agra on imperial orders and transported to Delhi. Imprisoned and tortured, Bhai Dayala steadfastly refused to convert. On November 11, 1675, following the sawing of Bhai Mati Das in half, Bhai Dayala boldly denounced Aurangzeb as a tyrant, cursing the Mughal atrocities committed in the name of religion and prophesying the empire's downfall. He was then bound with iron chains, positioned in a large cauldron of boiling water, and roasted alive, emerging as a symbol of Sikh resilience. His execution occurred in direct view of Guru Tegh Bahadur at a kotwali (police station) in Chandni Chowk, Delhi."

  "spiritualLegacy": {
    "description": "Bhai Dayala's martyrdom embodies the Sikh ethos of dharam yudh (righteous struggle) and sarbatt da bhala (welfare of all humanity). His refusal to abandon faith, even under extreme torture, underscores the Gurus' teachings on religious liberty and courage. As part of the trio of martyrs (with Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das) executed before Guru Tegh Bahadur, his sacrifice directly preceded and inspired the Guru's own beheading two days later on November 11, 1675, galvanizing the Sikh community against oppression.",
    "keyContributions": [
      "Exemplified unwavering devotion and administrative service to the Sikh Gurus, bridging eastern and central Sikh centers.",
      "His recitation of Japji Sahib during execution reinforced the power of Gurbani (Sikh scriptures) as a source of spiritual strength in adversity.",
      "Contributed to the preservation of Sikh identity during a period of intense Mughal persecution, influencing the militarization and resilience of the faith under subsequent Gurus."
