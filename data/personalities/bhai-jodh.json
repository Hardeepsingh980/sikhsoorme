      "value": "Little is documented about Bhai Jodh's early life due to the oral tradition of Sikh history during that period. He is believed to have been born in the late 16th century in rural Punjab, possibly in the Amritsar or Tarn Taran region. As a young Sikh, he was inspired by the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and became a devoted follower of Guru Hargobind, who assumed guruship in 1606 after the martyrdom of his father, Guru Arjan Dev. Bhai Jodh likely joined the Sikh community during the formative years of the Akal Sena, the Sikh military force established by Guru Hargobind to defend the faith against Mughal persecution. Historical accounts suggest he was a farmer or artisan by trade before dedicating himself fully to the Guru's cause.

He participated in several skirmishes and battles against Mughal forces, including defenses around Amritsar. His service exemplified the Sikh principle of Miri-Piri (temporal and spiritual authority), as he fought to protect the Sikh community from religious persecution. Bhai Jodh is particularly noted for his role in supporting Guru Hargobind during the Guru's imprisonment in Gwalior Fort (1617‚Äì1619) and subsequent release, where he may have been among the 52 kings freed alongside the Guru, symbolizing collective liberation. His unwavering loyalty made him a role model for early Sikhs embracing the warrior saint (Sant-Sipahi) ideal.
