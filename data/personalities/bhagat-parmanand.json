      "value": "Bhagat Parmanand was born around 1483 in a Gaur (or Kanyakubja) Brahmin family. Sources vary on his birthplace: primary Sikh references, such as the Encyclopedia of Sikhism, place him in BƒÅrsƒ´ (north of Pandharpur) in present-day Sholapur district, Maharashtra, aligning with the regional Bhakti traditions. Other accounts suggest origins in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh. From a young age, Parmanand exhibited deep devotion to Vishnu, particularly in the form of Krishna (worshipped as Shri Nathji). He was initiated into the Pushtimarg (Path of Grace) sampradaya by the renowned philosopher-saint Shri Vallabhacharya, becoming a brother-disciple to the blind poet Surdas. Parmanand's early life was marked by rigorous ascetic practices, including performing seven hundred genuflections daily on bare knees, often leading to physical hardship as an expression of his thirst for divine union, symbolized by his nom de plume \"Sara√±g\" (a bird yearning for raindrops)."

      "value": "Parmanand's primary contribution to Sikhism and broader Indian spirituality lies in his poetic expressions of bhakti (devotion), which emphasize inner purity, selfless service (seva), and the company of holy saints (sadh sangat) over mere ritualistic practices. His inclusion in the Guru Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan Dev Ji underscores the universal appeal of his teachings, which align with Sikh principles of ethical living and rejection of hypocrisy. As a Vaishnava saint, he promoted devotion to Krishna while advocating for compassion toward all beings. His life exemplified dedication to spiritual discipline, influencing the Bhakti movement's emphasis on personal realization and social service. Unverified traditions suggest he engaged in teaching and composing devotional songs that critiqued social vices like lust, anger, and greed (citationNeeded)."

      "value": "Parmanand advocated a shift from idol worship and rote scriptural recitation to genuine devotion manifested through ethical actions, such as feeding the hungry and avoiding cruelty. He highlighted the futility of rituals without inner transformation, promoting the value of sadh sangat for spiritual growth. This reformist outlook resonated with the Sikh Gurus' teachings against empty formalism, influencing the compilation of the Adi Granth. His emphasis on nirguna (formless) aspects of the Divine marked a personal evolution from saguna (attributed) worship, bridging Vaishnava and Sikh philosophies."

This composition critiques hypocritical religious practices and calls for true bhakti through service and moral purity. Outside the GGS, Parmanand is credited with numerous unpublished or lost devotional songs (bhajans) in Hindi/Marathi, focused on Krishna bhakti, though these are not systematically documented (citationNeeded). His writings reflect the Bhakti tradition's poetic style, using simple language to convey profound spiritual truths."

No specific accounts of his death exist in verified sources."

    "description": "Bhagat Parmanand's legacy endures through his singular contribution to the Guru Granth Sahib, symbolizing the inclusive spirit of Sikh scripture that incorporates voices from diverse Bhakti saints. His teachings reinforce core Sikh values: simran (remembrance of God), seva (selfless service), and eradication of the five vices (kaam, krodh, lobh, moh, ahankaar). As a bridge between Vaishnavism and Sikhism, he exemplifies how personal devotion transcends sectarian boundaries.",
