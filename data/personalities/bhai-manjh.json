He constructed a Dharamshala for communal gatherings and recitation of Gurbani. Despite severe backlash, including loss of wealth and status, he performed exemplary seva in Amritsar, such as collecting wood for the langar, cleaning utensils, and serving the sangat. Later, he was appointed by the Guru to propagate Sikhism in the Doaba region, where he established a renowned langar at his home, converting numerous individuals and fostering community service."
