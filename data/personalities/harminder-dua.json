      "value": "Harminder Singh Dua was born in Jalandhar, Punjab, India, into a Sikh family during the post-independence era when India was undergoing significant social and educational reforms. Growing up in a region with a rich Sikh heritage but facing economic challenges, Dua developed an early interest in medicine. He pursued his medical education at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur, Maharashtra, graduating with an MBBS degree. This institution, established in 1947, was part of India's expanding public health infrastructure post-Partition. After completing his studies, Dua specialized in ophthalmology, driven by a passion for restoring vision in underserved communities. His early career took him to the United States, where he served as an associate professor at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, honing his expertise in corneal research amid the advanced medical landscape of the 1980s and 1990s."

      "value": "Dua's career is marked by pioneering work in ophthalmology, particularly in corneal transplantation and ocular surface diseases. Joining the University of Nottingham in April 1994, he rose to become Chair and Professor of Ophthalmology and Head of the Division of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. He has led numerous clinical trials and surgical innovations, training hundreds of specialists worldwide. As a leader, Dua served as President of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (UK) from 2011 to 2014, advocating for improved eye care standards. He also held presidencies in EuCornea and EVERf, fostering international collaboration. His service extends to public health, including advisory roles in chemical injury protocols and vision research funding. Dua's work has directly benefited the Sikh diaspora and global communities by advancing treatments for blindness."

      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "In 2001, Dua proposed the \"Dua Classification\" for ocular chemical injuries, a standardized system that grades burns based on limbal involvement and percentage of conjunctival damage (grades I‚ÄìIV). This reform has improved triage and treatment in emergency ophthalmology, reducing long-term complications like corneal scarring. His 2013 discovery of Dua's Layer‚Äîa tough, 15-micrometre-thick acellular layer in the cornea‚Äîhas reformed surgical techniques, such as Descemet's Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK), by providing a stronger barrier against air leaks and enhancing graft survival. Despite initial controversy over eponymous naming, it has been integrated into ophthalmic nomenclature and textbooks."

      "value": "Dua is a prolific author with over 500 publications in peer-reviewed journals. He co-edited the *British Journal of Ophthalmology* and authored key texts on corneal surgery. Notable works include the 2013 paper in *Ophthalmology* detailing Dua's Layer (\"Human corneal anatomy redefined: a novel pre-Descemet's layer (Dua's layer)\"), which has been cited thousands of times. His writings emphasize evidence-based reforms, such as guidelines for ocular trauma and transplant ethics. Dua has also contributed to *The Way Forward* report (2017) on ophthalmic service redesign."

He remains active in research, focusing on regenerative eye therapies, and mentors young Sikh scientists in the UK."
