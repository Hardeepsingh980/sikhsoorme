      "value": "Bibi Amro was born in 1532 in the village of Khadur Sahib, near present-day Amritsar, Punjab, India. She was the daughter of Guru Angad Dev, the second Sikh Guru, and Mata Khivi, a prominent figure known for her contributions to the langar (community kitchen) tradition. Bibi Amro had two brothers, Baba Dasu and Baba Datu, and a younger sister, Bibi Anokhi. From a young age, she received direct education from her parents. Guru Angad taught her to read and write in the revised Gurmukhi script, which he had simplified to promote literacy among Sikhs. She also memorized sacred hymns, including complex compositions like Sidh Gosht by Guru Nanak. Described as talented and gifted with a sweet voice, Bibi Amro was raised in a spiritually rich environment, imbibing the core Sikh principles of equality, devotion, and service."

      "value": "Bibi Amro's most significant contribution was her role in introducing Amar Das (later Guru Amar Das) to Sikhism. Living with her in-laws in Basarke village after marriage, she would sing Gurbani shabads while performing household duties. Amar Das, her husband's uncle and a devout Hindu on pilgrimages to Haridwar, overheard her reciting a hymn by Guru Nanak (from page 990 of the Guru Granth Sahib: Bhaeiaa munoor ku(n)chun fir hovai jae gur milai thinaehaa...). Deeply moved, he sought her out, and through her encouragement, she accompanied him to meet Guru Angad in Khadur Sahib around 1539. This encounter transformed Amar Das into a devoted Sikh, leading to his eventual appointment as the third Guru in 1552. Later, under Guru Amar Das's organizational reforms, Bibi Amro was appointed head of one of the 22 Manjis (preaching districts), covering areas including Basarke. In this role, she preached Sikh teachings, led kirtan (devotional singing), and organized congregations, helping institutionalize Sikhism's structure."

This innovation promoted gender equality in religious leadership, as women like Bibi Amro were entrusted with significant responsibilities akin to bishops in other faiths. Her efforts helped expand Sikhism in rural Punjab, fostering community welfare and challenging prevailing social hierarchies."
