      "value": "Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, into a Jat Sikh family in the village of Banga (or Chak No. 105 GB, near Lyallpur, present-day Faisalabad, Pakistan) to Kishan Singh Sandhu and Vidyavati Kaur. His family had a strong tradition of patriotism; his father and uncles were involved in earlier anti-colonial activities, including the Ghadar Movement. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 profoundly impacted young Bhagat, who was 12 at the time, fueling his anti-British sentiments. He joined Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement in 1921 at age 14, burning his schoolbooks in protest. Disillusioned by Gandhi's suspension of the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident (1922), Singh turned to revolutionary socialism. He studied at National College in Lahore but left to avoid an arranged marriage and joined the Naujawan Bharat Sabha (Youth Society of India) in 1926. By 1928, he co-founded the HSRA, inspired by Bolshevik and anarchist ideas, and edited Urdu/Punjabi newspapers in Amritsar. (Sources: Wikipedia summary; SikhiWiki early life section)"

      "value": "As a leader in the HSRA, Singh organized armed resistance against British rule, aiming to overthrow colonialism through revolutionary action. He participated in the boycott of the Simon Commission (1928), protesting the all-British panel reviewing Indian reforms. In retaliation for Lala Lajpat Rai's death during a lathi charge ordered by British officer James Scott, Singh and Shivaram Rajguru assassinated Assistant Superintendent John Saunders on December 17, 1928, in Lahore (mistaking him for Scott). This act avenged Rai and symbolized militant defiance. Singh evaded capture initially, traveling to Calcutta to learn bomb-making. He contributed to underground literature, including pamphlets promoting socialism and workers' rights. His actions galvanized youth across Punjab and northern India, shifting focus toward radicalism within the independence movement.

He pushed for better prison conditions for political prisoners through his 1929 hunger strike, demanding equality with European inmates (e.g., access to books, newspapers, and hygienic facilities). This strike, lasting 116 days for Singh personally, highlighted systemic discrimination and led to partial concessions. His writings critiqued religious dogma and promoted rationalism, influencing early Indian Marxism. Though executed young, his legacy reformed youth involvement in politics, inspiring non-Congress factions to demand total independence over dominion status.

He argued, \"Non-belief in existence of God in the man who thinks and reasons is nothing but perfectly natural.\" (citationNeeded: Full text availability in public domain, but verification from SikhiWiki).  \n- Leaflets from the Assembly Bombing (1929): Declaring, \"It takes a loud noise to make the deaf hear,\" criticizing repressive laws like the Public Safety Bill.  \n- Articles in *Kirti* and *Naujawan Bharat* magazines: Essays on Punjab's problems, Marxism, and anti-imperialism.  \nHe also translated revolutionary texts and wrote poetry inspired by Allama Iqbal. Later, influenced by Bhai Randhir Singh in jail, he reportedly reaffirmed Sikh spiritual values. (Cross-verified: Wikipedia writings; SikhiWiki atheism section)"

Sentenced to life imprisonment initially, his involvement in the Saunders murder led to the Lahore Conspiracy Case trial. From June 1929, he led a hunger strike in Mianwali and Lahore jails, joined by comrades like Jatin Das (who died after 63 days). Transferred to Lahore Central Jail, Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were sentenced to death on October 7, 1930. Appeals to the Privy Council and Viceroy Lord Irwin failed, despite Gandhi's intercession. On March 23, 1931, they were hanged prematurely at 7:30 PM (to avoid public unrest), their bodies cremated secretly at Husainiwala. (Sources: Wikipedia execution; SikhiWiki trial and death sentence)"

    "description": "Rooted in Sikhism, Singh initially embraced atheism as a rational response to colonial oppression and religious exploitation. However, in his final days in Lahore Jail, he met Sikh spiritual leader Bhai Randhir Singh, who engaged him in discussions on Gurbani (Sikh scriptures). This led to a reported spiritual reawakening, where Singh reaffirmed belief in God and Sikh principles of sacrifice (shaheedi). His life embodied Sikh ideals of courage (bir ras) and justice, while his rationalism challenged superstition. As a \"Shaheed,\" he symbolizes selfless martyrdom in Sikh history.",

Repressive laws (e.g., Public Safety Bill) targeted revolutionaries, while Gandhi's Congress pushed non-violence, contrasting Singh's militancy.",

His martyrdom accelerated pressure on Britain, contributing to independence in 1947. In Sikh history, he exemplifies shaheedi (martyrdom) against tyranny.
