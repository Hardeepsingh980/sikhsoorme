      "value": "Prithi Chand's \"contributions\" are primarily within the context of the Mina sect, which he founded in opposition to the mainstream Sikh Guruship. After Guru Ram Das appointed his youngest son, Arjan Dev, as the fifth Guru, Prithi Chand established his own spiritual seat in Kotha Guru (near Bathinda) and later in Heir village, strategically located between Amritsar and Lahore. He actively tried to divert pilgrims and followers from Guru Arjan Dev's path, attempting to portray himself as the rightful Guru. He created a parallel scripture that incorporated hymns of earlier Gurus along with his own compositions, aiming to solidify his claim and attract a following. His actions led to significant internal strife within the Sikh community during a critical period of its development."

      "value": "Prithi Chand continued to lead the Mina sect until his death in April 1618. His efforts to establish a separate lineage and his opposition to Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Hargobind had a lasting, though controversial, impact on early Sikh history. The Mina sect continued after his death, at times gaining control of key Sikh centers like Amritsar, which necessitated Guru Hargobind's relocation."

  "historicalContext": {
    "period": "Prithi Chand lived during a pivotal period in Sikh history, spanning the late 16th and early 17th centuries. This era saw the consolidation of Sikh institutions under Guru Ram Das and Guru Arjan Dev, and the nascent community's increasing prominence.",
    "politicalSituation": "The region was under the rule of the powerful Mughal Empire. The Sikh Gurus maintained a complex relationship with Mughal authorities, which at times involved persecution and, at others, periods of relative tolerance. Prithi Chand is noted for having sought official support from the Mughal Empire to bolster his claim to the Guruship.",
    "socialConditions": "Sikhism was rapidly expanding, attracting followers from diverse social and economic backgrounds due to its egalitarian message and emphasis on devotional practice (Bhakti). The growing influence of the Sikh faith, however, also led to internal challenges, such as disputes over succession and external pressures from both religious and political adversaries.",
    "significance": "Prithi Chand's actions and the emergence of the Mina sect are significant as they represent the first major internal challenge to the spiritual authority and succession principles within Sikhism. The unwavering rejection of his claims by the mainstream Sikh community underscored the principle of spiritual merit (Gurgaddi) over hereditary succession, a crucial aspect that solidified the distinct identity and organizational structure of the Sikh faith. His rivalry also contributed to the eventual martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev, as Prithi Chand is believed to have instigated some of the animosity from the Mughal court."
