He was born into the Chheepa caste, traditionally involved in dyeing and printing cloth, in the Punjab region during the 16th century. As a humble artisan, he likely encountered the teachings of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad before becoming a close disciple of Guru Amar Das. The social conditions of the time were marked by caste rigidities and Mughal influence, which the Sikh Gurus challenged through egalitarian practices. Bhai Dasa's transition to Sikhism reflects the inclusive nature of the faith that attracted artisans and laborers.

He dedicated himself to the langar (community kitchen) at Goindval, where he tirelessly served meals to visitors regardless of caste or status. His profession as a chheepa allowed him to contribute practically, possibly by providing dyed cloths for the langar or community needs. Guru Amar Das personally appreciated his humility and devotion, often citing him as an example of true Sikh conduct. His service helped strengthen the institution of langar, a cornerstone of Sikhism promoting equality and community welfare. He also propagated the Guru's teachings among his community, fostering early Sikh sangats (congregations)."
