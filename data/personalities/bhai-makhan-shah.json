      "value": "Bhai Makhan Shah was born in 1619 into a prominent Lubana family, a community known for their trading and nomadic lifestyle. His father, Bhai Dasa Labana, was a devout Sikh follower of the sixth Guru, Guru Hargobind. The exact birthplace is subject to scholarly debate: some sources, like Giani Gian Singh, suggest Tanda (possibly in Kashmir), while others, including Max Arthur Macauliffe and G.S. Chabra, point to Kathiawar in Gujarat as his native region. Bhatt Vahis records describe his ancestry: son of Bhai Dasa, grandson of Binai, and maternal grandson of Beheru. He accompanied his father on pilgrimages, including to Mutton Martand in Kashmir, where Bhai Dasa passed away. Makhan Shah was multilingual, proficient in Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and his native Labanki dialect. He married Sital Devi (also known as Suljai), daughter of Naik Puroshotam Das from the Sandlas Rajput clan, following Rajput customs. They had a son, Bhai Lal Das, who later became Naik Jawahar Singh after baptism by Guru Gobind Singh and was martyred in the Battle of Chamkaur in 1704."

      "value": "As a successful merchant, Bhai Makhan Shah continued his family's trading legacy, operating an extensive network that spanned Mughal India and beyond. He traded in spices, Bengali silk, and Kashmir shawls, using caravans with camels, oxen, and horses within India, and a fleet of ships for international voyages reaching the Mediterranean, Egypt, and as far as Portugal. His business acumen made him wealthy, but his devotion to Sikhism defined his service. In 1664, during a severe storm that threatened his ship, he vowed to offer 500 gold mohurs to the Guru if saved. Upon safe arrival in Kandahar, he sought the Guru but found confusion after Guru Har Rai's passing, with multiple claimants. Traveling to Punjab, he tested nine pretenders in villages like Kartarpur and Kiratpur; none passed his ritual of placing a coconut on their head (symbolizing protection). In Bakala, Guru Tegh Bahadur, meditating in obscurity, touched the coconut to his own head, preventing it from breaking‚Äîconfirming his authenticity. Overjoyed, Makhan Shah jumped in ecstasy, bowing so low his forehead touched the ground, earning the name \"Bhatta\" (forehead-toucher). He fulfilled his vow and later donated an additional 500 mohurs when the Guru symbolically placed them on his feet. He preached Sikhism extensively in West Punjab and abroad, punished the rebellious Dhir Mal and his masand Shihan for attacking Guru Tegh Bahadur, and assisted in settling the Guru at Anandpur Sahib. Under Guru Tegh Bahadur's command, he led a naval expedition with his fleet against the Yusufzai tribes in the northwest, who had been harassing Sikhs, demonstrating his role as a warrior."
