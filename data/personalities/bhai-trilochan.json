      "value": "Detailed accounts of Bhai Trilochan's early life are scarce in primary sources, as was common for non-Guru figures in early Sikh historiography. He was born in the Punjab region during the late 16th or early 17th century into a Sikh family devoted to the teachings of the Gurus. From a young age, he immersed himself in the study of Gurbani (Sikh scriptures) and the philosophy of the Sikh Gurus. His intellectual prowess drew him to the court of Guru Hargobind in Amritsar, where he became a close associate. Historical texts suggest he received spiritual guidance directly from the Guru, shaping his role as a scholar (citationNeeded; based on janamsakhi traditions)."

      "value": "Bhai Trilochan served as a key figure in Guru Hargobind's darbar (court), contributing to the dissemination and defense of Sikh teachings. During the Guru's era, marked by the introduction of miri-piri (temporal and spiritual authority), Bhai Trilochan participated in religious discussions and debates. He is particularly noted for defending the Sikh faith against challenges from Muslim and Hindu scholars who questioned the Guru's authority and Sikh doctrines. His service included advising the Guru on scriptural matters and supporting the community's resilience against Mughal oppression. He accompanied the Guru during travels and battles, embodying the Sikh ethos of saint-soldier (citationNeeded; referenced in Sikh historical narratives like the Guru Prakash)."

He advocated for the practical application of Sikh principles in daily life, emphasizing ethical living over superficial religious practices. His debates helped clarify Sikh distinctiveness from Hinduism and Islam, aiding the solidification of Sikh identity (citationNeeded)."
