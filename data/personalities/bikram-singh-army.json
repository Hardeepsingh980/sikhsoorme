      "value": "General Bikram Singh was born on 19 July 1952 in Amritsar, Punjab, India. He spent his early childhood with his family in Jammu. In 1962, he joined Punjab Public School, Nabha, where he excelled in Zoology and Biology, initially aspiring to become a doctor. However, the Indo-China War of 1962 and the Indo-Pak War of 1965 inspired him to pursue a military career. He joined the National Defence Academy (NDA) in 1968 as part of the 40th course. Reflecting on his choice, Singh stated, \"If I were ever to be born again, I would only join the Indian Army.\" He was commissioned into the Sikh Light Infantry on 31 March 1972 after passing out from the Indian Military Academy (IMA). At IMA, he earned the J&K Rifles Gold Medal in Leadership and Tactics, the Shrinagesh Trophy in firing, and was adjudged the Best Young Officer at the Infantry School. He also received the Commando Dagger for best commando and the Best in Tactics trophy, later serving as an instructor at the Commando and Weapons Wings of the Infantry School. (citation: Wikipedia)"
