      "value": "Alex Sangha, born Amar Singh Sangha, entered the world in Gravesend, Kent, England, to Sikh parents from Punjab, India‚Äîfather Dalbir Singh Sangha and mother Jaspal Kaur Sangha. His family immigrated to Canada, where he was primarily raised by his mother in the metro Vancouver area, specifically in Surrey and North Delta, British Columbia. Growing up in a devout Sikh household, Sangha experienced a culturally rich yet challenging environment as a South Asian immigrant child. He has two brothers (an older and younger) and a half-brother from his father's second marriage. As a teenager, Sangha grappled with his sexual orientation, describing his coming-out experience as deeply alienating and isolating, compounded by internalized homophobia within the conservative South Asian community. This personal struggle profoundly shaped his future advocacy work. He completed high school at Frank Hurt Secondary in Surrey and pursued higher education, earning an Associate of Arts from Douglas College in New Westminster, BC."

      "value": "Sangha's career spans social work, counseling, and filmmaking, all centered on supporting marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals of South Asian descent. In April 2008, he founded Sher Vancouver as an online Yahoo group, which evolved into a registered charity providing peer support, education, and resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) South Asians and allies. Under his leadership, Sher Vancouver became a cornerstone for queer Sikhs, offering safe spaces and combating stigma. As a Registered Clinical Social Worker and Registered Clinical Counsellor, Sangha maintains a private practice in North Delta, BC, where he provides therapy focused on mental health, trauma, and identity issues. Previously, he worked as an instructor, clinician, social worker, team leader, and youth counselor in various settings. In 2016, he personally supported a disowned Sikh international student from Punjab, integrating him into his family network. Sangha's documentary work amplifies these voices: his short film *My Name Was January* (citationNeeded ‚Äì production year) won 14 awards and 66 festival selections worldwide, while his feature debut *Emergence: Out of the Shadows* (premiered circa 2020) earned Best Documentary at festivals like the Vancouver International South Asian Film Festival and was selected for major events including Frameline and KASHISH Mumbai."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Sangha has been instrumental in reforming attitudes toward LGBTQ+ inclusion within Sikh and South Asian communities, traditionally conservative on issues of sexuality. Through Sher Vancouver, he promoted family acceptance programs, culminating in his mother's 2018 speech on embracing her gay son, which received a standing ovation and symbolized shifting generational norms. As the first Sikh Grand Marshal of the Vancouver Pride Parade (citationNeeded ‚Äì exact year), he broke barriers for religious minorities in queer spaces. His advocacy extends to mental health, sharing his experiences with bipolar disorder in a 2020 commentary for the London School of Economics Alumni, framing it as a source of creative humanitarianism. In May 2020, he published a piece in *The Times of India* detailing a transformative \"spiritual experience\" at age 19 that reconciled his Sikh faith with his identity, influencing his career in social justice."
