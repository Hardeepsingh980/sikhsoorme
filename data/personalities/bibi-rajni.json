      "value": "Bibi Rajni was born in Patti, Punjab, as the youngest of seven daughters to Rai Duni Chand, a prominent revenue collector (kardar) during the 16th century. Raised in a materially affluent household, she developed deep Sikh values and piety from an early age, becoming a devoted disciple (Sikh) of the Guru's teachings. Her sisters often praised their father's generosity for material gifts like clothing, but Rajni humbly attributed all blessings to Waheguru (God), viewing human providers as mere instruments. This perspective, rooted in Sikh philosophy of humility and divine grace, frequently clashed with her father's ego, foreshadowing conflicts. Historical context places her in the early Sikh community under Guru Ram Das (1574‚Äì1581 CE), a time of spiritual awakening amid Mughal rule and caste rigidities."

      "icon": "",
      "value": "Bibi Rajni's life exemplified selfless service (seva) and unwavering faith. After her forced marriage to a leper named Mohan (citationNeeded; inferred from related sakhis), she begged for sustenance while tenderly caring for her afflicted husband‚Äîbathing him, feeding him, and pulling him in a cart despite societal scorn. She practiced constant Naam Simran (remembrance of God's name), seeing her trials as divine tests. This devotion not only sustained her but indirectly led to the site's recognition as sacred, influencing Guru Ram Das's decision to establish Goindwal and later Amritsar. Her story promoted gender equality in spiritual practice, challenging norms where women's roles were subservient; she treated her husband as an embodiment of the divine, aligning with Gurbani's view of the soul's union with God."

Rai Duni Chand, who had suffered business losses and poverty (citationNeeded; linked to a separate sakhi of Guru Nanak testing him), sought refuge with his daughter in his final days, humbled by her faith. Bibi Rajni raised seven sons, embodying grihasth (householder) life while upholding Sikh values, until her passing (exact date unknown)."

  "spiritualLegacy": {
    "description": "Bibi Rajni's sakhi (legendary account) teaches that true devotion transcends material hardship, rewarding the faithful with divine intervention. It underscores Sikh tenets of sabad (accepting divine will), seva, and equality, showing that spiritual merit outweighs social status or wealth. Her story is preserved in Sikh oral traditions and sikh literature, inspiring generations to maintain faith amid adversity.",
    "keyContributions": [
      "Exemplified Naam Simran as a path to miracles, reinforcing Guru's teachings on inner strength.",
      "Her trials at the pool site led to its sanctification, paving the way for the Golden Temple's foundation and Amritsar's establishment as a Sikh spiritual center.",

  "modernRelevance": {
    "description": "In contemporary Sikhism, Bibi Rajni symbolizes resilience and pure faith, relevant in discussions of gender roles, mental fortitude, and environmental sanctity (e.g., sarovars' healing symbolism amid pollution concerns).
