      "value": "Bhai Satta Doom was born into a Muslim Doom-Mirasi family, a caste traditionally associated with music, drumming, and genealogy in Punjab. Little is known of his exact birthdate or place, but he emerged in Sikh historical records during the guruship of Guru Angad Dev (1539‚Äì1552). As a young musician, Satta began serving in the Guru's darbar (court) playing the dholak (drum), while his brother or close associate, Rai Balvand, played the rabab (rebec). This musical duo contributed to the early development of Sikh kirtan (devotional singing), drawing from the tradition established by Bhai Mardana under Guru Nanak. Historical accounts, such as those in Bhai Santokh Singh's *Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth*, describe their entry into Sikh service shortly after Guru Angad's succession, reflecting the inclusive ethos of early Sikhism that welcomed talents from diverse backgrounds amid the socio-religious turmoil of Mughal-influenced Punjab."

      "value": "Satta Doom and Rai Balvand served four consecutive Sikh Gurus: Angad, Amar Das (1552‚Äì1574), Ram Das (1574‚Äì1581), and Arjan Dev (1581‚Äì1606). They performed sabad kirtan (hymn recitation) in the Gurus' courts, enhancing the devotional atmosphere and spreading Sikh teachings through music. Their service was integral to the daily routines at key Sikh centers like Khadoor Sahib and Goindval. A pivotal contribution came during Guru Arjan's era when they co-composed *Ramkali ki Vaar*, a ballad of eight pauris (stanzas) included in the Adi Granth (predecessor to the Guru Granth Sahib). This composition arose from a period of personal trial: the duo, growing arrogant over their indispensability, once refused to perform for Baba Buddha (a senior Sikh) and later demanded excessive offerings from Guru Arjan for a family marriage. Feeling slighted, they left the Guru's service and spoke disparagingly of the Guru lineage, leading to their ostracism and affliction with leprosy. Through the intercession of a devoted Sikh named Laddha (who humbled himself with ashes as per the Guru's condition), they were forgiven. Miraculously healed, they returned and dedicated their hymn as penance, praising the divine continuity of Guruship."

It extols the first five Gurus as manifestations of the same eternal light (*jyot*), starting with Guru Nanak and emphasizing Guru Angad's enthronement as his successor. The hymn uses vivid metaphors of divine sovereignty and humility, underscoring themes of forgiveness and spiritual lineage. Cross-verified in the Guru Granth Sahib (standard recension) and historical janamsakhis. No other independent writings attributed solely to Satta are recorded."

They passed away during the early years of Guru Hargobind's guruship (post-1606) in Lahore. Tradition holds they were buried on the banks of the River Ravi, with funeral rites conducted by Bhai Babak, Guru Hargobind's rababi. Their deaths marked the end of a notable musical lineage in early Sikhism, but their bani endures in scripture."
