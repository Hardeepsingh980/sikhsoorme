      "value": "Bhai Langah was born into a Dhillon Jat family in Jhabal Kalan village, in the present-day Amritsar district of Punjab. His family was originally Hindu, but his father converted to Islam after becoming a devotee of the mystic Pir Sakhi Sarwar, adopting the name Abu-al-Khair. As a young man, Langah rose to prominence as one of the three chaudharis (revenue officials) of the Patti parganah under the Mughal Governor of Lahore. He was responsible for collecting a substantial revenue of Rs 900,000 from the villages in his jurisdiction, personally overseeing 84 villages. This position placed him in a role of significant administrative and economic influence in a region marked by Mughal oversight and local agrarian society (citation: SikhiWiki, Mahima Prakash)."

      "value": "In the 1580s, during the early guruship of Guru Arjan Dev (1563‚Äì1606), Bhai Langah suffered a severe illness unresponsive to medical treatment or prayers to Sakhi Sarwar. Advised by a Sikh to pray to God and Guru Nanak, he recovered miraculously and, along with his younger brother Piro Shah (also spelled Pero Shah), embraced Sikhism. Demonstrating deep devotion, he contributed both manual labor and financial resources to the excavation of the Amritsar Sarovar (pool of nectar) and the construction of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple). Guru Arjan recognized his sincerity and appointed him as a masand, responsible for propagating Sikh teachings and collecting offerings in his local area. Bhai Langah was honored as one of Guru Arjan's \"five beloved ones\" (alongside Bidhi Chand, Bhai Jetha, Bhai Pirana, and Bhai Pera), a select group of devoted Sikhs. He participated in Guru Hargobind's wedding procession in 1604 and was among the five Sikhs who accompanied Guru Arjan on his final journey to Lahore, where he witnessed the Guru's torture and martyrdom in 1606, assisting in the cremation of his remains (citation: SikhiWiki; Wikipedia on Panj Pyare; The Sikh Religion by M.A. Macauliffe)."

His role as masand helped institutionalize Sikh community organization. Under Guru Hargobind, he supported the militarization of the Sikh panth by serving as a commander in the newly formed Sikh forces, training in martial skills while upholding religious piety. He was tasked with maintaining a shrine in Lahore at the site of Guru Arjan's cremation, preserving Sikh sacred spaces amid Mughal persecution (citation: Suraj Prakash; Mahima Prakash)."

He passed away at a ripe old age in Dhilwan (on the banks of the River Beas in present-day Kapurthala district, Punjab), leaving a legacy through his descendants, including the Dhillon lineage that produced notable Sikhs like General Baghel Singh of the Karorsinghia Misl, who led Sikh forces into Delhi in 1783 (citation: SikhiWiki; Mahima Prakash)."

    "description": "Bhai Langah's life story highlights the transformative power of Sikh faith in healing and community building. His devotion from a position of worldly power to selfless service underscores Sikh ideals of humility, equality, and resistance to oppression. As one of Guru Arjan's five beloved ones, he represents the early cadre of Sikhs who solidified the panth's foundations during a period of expansion and emerging Mughal hostility.",
