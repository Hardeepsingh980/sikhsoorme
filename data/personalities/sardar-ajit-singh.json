      "value": "Sardar Ajit Singh was born on 23 February 1881 in Khatkar Kalan, a village in the Jullundur Doab district of Punjab, into a Jat Sikh family with a military background. His father, Arjan Singh, and mother, Jai Kaur, instilled values of resilience and justice. His grandfather, Fateh Singh Sandhu, was a respected figure, and his elder brother, Kishen Singh Sandhu, later became the father of the renowned revolutionary Bhagat Singh. From a young age, Ajit displayed a rebellious spirit, questioning colonial authority, such as the mandatory salutes to British officials (sahibs). He received early education at the village school and matriculated from Sain Das Anglo Sanskrit High School in Jalandhar. He pursued higher studies at D.A.V. College in Lahore and enrolled in Law College, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. However, influenced by Arya Samaj's emphasis on social reform and nationalism, he abandoned his legal studies around 1903 to immerse himself in the freedom struggle. Attending Lord Curzon's Darbar in 1903, he attempted to unite Indian princes against British dominance, marking his early entry into political activism. (Sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki)"

      "value": "Ajit Singh's contributions were pivotal in mobilizing rural Punjab against colonial exploitation. In 1906, he co-founded the Bharat Mata Society with his brother Kishen Singh and Ghasita Ram to arouse public sentiment against British policies. He organized protests against the Punjab Colonization (Amendment) Act of 1906 and the Bari Doab Canal Act, which raised land revenue and water rates by 25%, threatening farmers' livelihoods. These efforts culminated in the Pagri Sambhal Jatta Movement (1907), a widespread peasant uprising symbolized by the slogan \"Pagri Sambhal Jatta\" (Protect your turban, O farmer), protesting land fragmentation rules and primogeniture favoring eldest sons, primarily affecting Sikh ex-soldiers in the Chenab Colony. He addressed rallies in cities like Lahore, Amritsar, and Rawalpindi, linking agrarian grievances to broader anti-colonial nationalism. Exiled, he continued service abroad: escaping to Iran in 1909 with Sufi Amba Prasad, publishing revolutionary tracts like *Baghi Masiha* and *Muhibbani Watan*; contacting the Ghadar Party in San Francisco (1918); and during World War II, teaching Persian in Naples, Italy, while broadcasting in Hindustani to Indian troops in North Africa, urging them to defect and form an Azad Hind Fauj. He raised over 10,000 Indian POWs for an anti-British army in Italy, advising Subhas Chandra Bose on recruitment tactics. His global travels—to Turkey, Russia, Paris, Brazil, Switzerland, and Germany—facilitated networking with revolutionaries like Lala Har Dayal, Trotsky, and Mussolini, amplifying India's cause internationally.

He attended the Asian Relations Conference in Delhi before retiring to Dalhousie, Himachal Pradesh, for health reasons. Weakened by decades of exile, imprisonment (including in Italy and Germany), and poor conditions, he died peacefully on 15 August 1947—the day India gained independence—at age 66 in Panjpulla, Dalhousie. His last words: \"Thank God, my mission is fulfilled.\" A samadhi memorial was erected at Panjpulla, honoring his lifelong dedication. (Sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki, Deol's *Shahid Ajit Singh*)"

The 1907 agitations coincided with the 50th anniversary of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, heightening British fears of rebellion. World War I and II provided opportunities for Indian nationalists to exploit global alliances.",
    "socialConditions": "Punjab's agrarian economy burdened Jat Sikh farmers with rising taxes and land restrictions amid famines and militarization. Arya Samaj and early Congress movements fostered Hindu-Sikh unity against divide-and-rule policies. Rural unrest reflected broader Indian discontent, paving the way for Gandhian non-violence and revolutionary militancy.",
    "significance": "Ajit Singh's work bridged rural protests to urban revolutions, influencing the Ghadar Movement and HSRA. His exile highlighted colonial suppression tactics, while his global efforts demonstrated early transnational anti-imperialism, contributing to India's 1947 independence. (Sources: Yadav, *M.P.T.
