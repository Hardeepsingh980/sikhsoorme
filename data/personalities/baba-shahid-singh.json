      "value": "Baba Deep Singh was born on January 26, 1682 (14 Maagh, Samvat 1739), in Pahuwind village, Amritsar district, to a Sandhu Jat Sikh family. His father, Bhagta Ji (a farmer), and mother, Jioni Ji, were devoted Sikhs. As their only child, he received much affection. At age 12, on Vaisakhi 1694 (1700 CE), he visited Anandpur Sahib with his parents and stayed at the request of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. There, he learned Gurmukhi, Sikh philosophy, and martial arts (horsemanship, archery, weaponry) from Bhai Mani Singh and the Guru. Baptized into the Khalsa at age 18 via Amrit Sanchar, he adopted the name Deep Singh. After eight years at Anandpur, he returned to Pahuwind in 1702, married, and assisted his parents until summoned to Damdama Sahib in 1705.

At Damdama Sahib (1705‚Äì1706), he assisted Bhai Mani Singh in compiling and hand-copying the Guru Granth Sahib, producing multiple volumes distributed to Takhts (Akal Takht, Patna Sahib, Hazur Sahib, Kesgarh Sahib). He inscribed one copy in Abjad (Arabic) script for outreach to the Middle East. Appointed head Granthi at Damdama Sahib in 1706, he preached Sikh teachings, wrote Gutkas (hymn books), and led sewa. Militarily, he joined Banda Singh Bahadur in 1709 for battles at Sadhaura and Chappar Chiri (avenging Guru's sons at Sirhind). In 1733, Nawab Kapur Singh appointed him leader of a jatha; by 1748, he headed the Shaheed Misl under Dal Khalsa. He rescued 300+ women and children from Ahmad Shah Durrani's 1756 raid near Kurukshetra, freeing captives and looting treasury. (Sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki; Prachin Panth Prakash, 1914)"

His leadership in pillaging post-Nadir Shah (1740) and establishing short-lived Sikh polity in Sirhind sarkar challenged Mughal decline.

By 1757, after Ahmad Shah Durrani desecrated Harmandir Sahib (blowing it up and polluting the sarovar), the 75-year-old Baba vowed to rebuild it. Rallying 500 Sikhs at Damdama Sahib, his force grew to 5,000 en route to Amritsar. He drew a line with his Khanda at Tarn Taran, reciting Ardas for only the committed to cross. Intercepted by 20,000 Mughal-Afghan troops under Jahan Khan near Goharwal, he fought fiercely with his 15kg Khanda. Beheaded by Jamal Khan, he held his head in his left palm and continued fighting, reciting Japji Sahib, until reaching Harmandir Sahib's parikarma, where he expired on November 13, 1757.
