During the early 16th century, under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate, he held a position in the administrative services, specifically managing the modikhana—a storehouse for revenues collected in non-cash forms such as grains and goods. This role placed him in a position of trust within the local governance structure, serving under governors like Daulat Khan Lodhi in the Lahore province."

      "value": "Bhai Jai Ram's primary contribution to Sikh history stems from his familial ties and support for Guru Nanak. In 1475, he married Bibi Nanaki, the elder sister of Guru Nanak, which brought the young Nanak to Sultanpur Lodhi after the marriage. This relocation was pivotal, as Sultanpur became a formative period for Guru Nanak's spiritual awakening. Bhai Jai Ram, recognizing Nanak's potential and piety, leveraged his position to secure employment for him in the modikhana around 1485–1500 CE. This job as a storekeeper (modi) allowed Guru Nanak to engage deeply with the spiritual dimensions of his role, leading to profound experiences, including his famous enlightenment episode at age 30, where he declared, \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim.\"\n\nHis service extended to fostering an environment where Guru Nanak could compose early writings, such as parts of the Japji Sahib. Bhai Jai Ram's household became a hub for spiritual discourse, with Nanak often debating religious ideas and promoting equality and devotion over ritualism."

Unlike more prominent figures, he did not author reforms but lived them by providing refuge and opportunities for the Guru's mission."
