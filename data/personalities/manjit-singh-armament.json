      "value": "Dr. Manjit Singh was born on November 18, 1958, in Punjab, India. Details of his early childhood and family background are not extensively documented in public sources, but his Punjabi heritage aligns him with the Sikh community prominent in the region. He pursued higher education at Panjab University, earning an M.Sc. in 1982, likely in a field related to physics or materials science. His academic journey culminated in a Ph.D. in 2001, focusing on \"Metals Under High Stress and Strain Rates,\" which laid the foundation for his specialized career in dynamic materials behavior under extreme conditions. This period coincided with India's post-independence push for scientific self-reliance, particularly in defense technologies following the 1962 and 1971 wars."

      "value": "Joining the DRDO, Dr. Singh specialized in critical areas of armament science, including the detonics of high explosives, high-pressure physics under dynamic shock wave loading, and the behavior of materials under high stress and strain rates. He has extensive experience in missiles, missile warheads, and strategic devices. A pivotal contribution was his role in the successful execution of India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, where his expertise in shock waves and explosives was instrumental. As Director of TBRL in Chandigarh since at least the early 2010s, he oversees research in terminal ballistics, ammunition, and explosive technologies essential for India's armed forces. He also heads the Quality Management Group in the Shock & Detonics Division and Gun Group. Beyond research, he serves on the Armament Research Board of India and the National Organizing Committee for conferences like ICOP-2009, promoting advancements in optics and photonics for defense applications. As Chairman of the DRDO North Zone Sports Council, he fosters employee well-being and team-building in a high-stakes scientific environment."
