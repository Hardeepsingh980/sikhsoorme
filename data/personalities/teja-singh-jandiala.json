      "value": "Teja Singh was born in 1883 in the village of Jandiala Guru, near Amritsar, Punjab, into a devout Sikh Jat family. Growing up during the height of British colonial rule, he witnessed the socio-religious challenges faced by the Sikh community, including the mismanagement of Gurdwaras by hereditary mahants (priests) who often exploited religious sites for personal gain. As a young man, Teja Singh received traditional Sikh education and was influenced by the Singh Sabha Movement, which aimed to reform and purify Sikh practices. He was actively involved in local Panthic activities from an early age. In 1919, at the age of 36, he participated in the Jallianwala Bagh protests in Amritsar, where British forces massacred unarmed civilians, further fueling his commitment to anti-colonial activism.

      "value": "Teja Singh emerged as a key figure in the Akali Movement, a non-violent campaign launched in the 1920s to liberate historic Gurdwaras from mahant control. He was one of the founding members of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) in November 1920, an elected body to manage Sikh shrines democratically. Elected as SGPC President in 1922, he led several morchas (peaceful processions), including the Guru ka Bagh Morcha (1922‚Äì1923), where Akali volunteers reclaimed a disputed Gurdwara site, enduring lathi charges and arrests. Teja Singh was imprisoned multiple times by British authorities for defying orders. He also co-founded the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in 1920, serving as a political platform for Sikh interests. His service extended to the Indian independence struggle; he joined Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement in 1921, mobilizing Sikhs against British rule. In 1926, he was elected to the Punjab Legislative Council, where he advocated for Sikh rights and land reforms.
