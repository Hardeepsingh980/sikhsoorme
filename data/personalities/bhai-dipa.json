      "value": "Little is documented about Bhai Dipa's early life, as historical records from the 17th century often focus on prominent figures. He was born in Punjab during the early 1600s, a time of rising tensions between the Sikh community and the Mughal Empire. Bhai Dipa likely came from a humble background and was drawn to Sikhism through the teachings of Guru Arjan Dev and later Guru Hargobind. His devotion grew under Guru Hargobind's leadership, who militarized the Sikhs in response to persecution following Guru Arjan's martyrdom in 1606. Bhai Dipa's early association with the Guru suggests he was among the early Sikhs who embraced the martial ethos of Miri-Piri (temporal and spiritual authority).

      "value": "Bhai Dipa's primary contribution was as an envoy for Guru Hargobind, the sixth Guru, who ruled from 1606 to 1644. During this era, Guru Hargobind faced multiple imprisonments and conflicts with Mughal governors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Bhai Dipa was dispatched on diplomatic missions to convey the Guru's messages, negotiate releases, or assert Sikh rights. One notable instance involved his role in communications during Guru Hargobind's imprisonment at Gwalior Fort (1617‚Äì1619), where he helped rally support among Sikhs and liaised with Mughal officials. His service exemplified the Sikh principle of sarbat da bhala (welfare of all), bridging conflicts through dialogue. He also likely participated in community service at Akal Takht, the newly established seat of authority in Amritsar. Sources indicate his travels took him to Delhi and Lahore, enduring hardships to fulfill the Guru's commands."

He contributed to the propagation of Sikh martial traditions, helping organize sangat (congregations) and langar (community kitchens) during times of war. No personal reforms are attributed, but his diplomatic efforts helped preserve Sikh autonomy. (N/A for major personal reforms; supported Guru's reforms)"
