      "value": "Bhai Randhir Singh was born on July 7, 1878, in Narangwal village, Ludhiana District, Punjab, into a devout Sikh family. His father, Natha Singh, was a scholar and judge in the Nabha High Court, fluent in Punjabi, Urdu, Persian, and English. His mother, Punjab Kaur, was a seventh-generation descendant of Bhai Bhagtu, a prominent Sikh associated with Guru Arjan and Guru Hargobind. Educated at Nabha and later at Government College and Forman Christian College in Lahore (1896‚Äì1900), he excelled academically and in sports, captaining the college hockey team. He distinguished himself as a poet in Urdu and Punjabi during his student days. In 1903, at age 25, he was baptized into the Khalsa alongside a Muslim family (Maulvi Karim Baksh), facing social ostracism for challenging caste prejudices prevalent among Sikhs at the time."

      "value": "Bhai Randhir Singh's life was marked by selfless service to Sikhism and India's freedom struggle. He resigned his government job to propagate Gurmat (Sikh teachings) and initiated Gurdwara reforms, confronting malpractices at sites like Fatehgarh Sahib and Anandpur Sahib. In 1914, he led protests against the British demolition of Rakabganj Gurdwara's wall in Delhi, organizing Panthic conferences that linked to the Ghadar Movement. As a freedom fighter, he joined the Ghadarites, resulting in his arrest in the Lahore Conspiracy Case (1915). He endured brutal tortures in prisons like Multan, fasting 40 days in extreme heat to maintain Rehat (Sikh code). Post-release in 1930, he founded the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, promoting strict adherence to Sikh discipline, Naam Simran (meditation on God's Name), and Akhand Kirtan (continuous singing of hymns). He traveled across India, conducting Kirtan Samagams and baptizing thousands, including those from marginalized backgrounds."

He refused government pensions or land restitution, living simply in Narangwal. He continued propagating Sikhism through Kirtan and writings until his death on Vaisakhi, April 13, 1961, at age 82. His cremation occurred near Gujjrawal-Narangwal. Before passing, he lamented the decadence in Panthic leadership, foreseeing renewal through inspired youth. He nominated no successor, entrusting the Jatha to collective Sangat decisions."

    "description": "Bhai Randhir Singh's legacy embodies the Khalsa ideal: a warrior-saint devoted to Naam, Rehat, and selfless service. His mystical experiences, like divine revelation of \"Waheguru\" as Gurmantar in 1903 and visions of Sachkhand in 1905, underscore direct communion with the Guru through Gurbani. He transformed Sikh practice by emphasizing constant Naam Simran, Akhand Kirtan, and Jhatka (ritual slaughter) as per Dasam Granth, rejecting Brahminical influences.",
    "keyContributions": [
      "Revived strict Amrit Sanchar, baptizing across castes and religions, fostering Panthic unity.",
