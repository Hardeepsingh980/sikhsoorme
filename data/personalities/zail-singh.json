      "value": "Giani Zail Singh was born on May 5, 1916, in the village of Sandhwan near Kot Kapura in the princely state of Faridkot, Punjab, to Kishan Singh, a carpenter and farmer, and Ind Kaur. The youngest of five brothers and one sister, he lost his mother early and was raised by his aunt, Daya Kaur. With limited formal education, Singh displayed a natural aptitude for Sikh religious studies. He trained as a granthi at the Shahid Sikh Missionary College in Amritsar, earning the title \"Giani\" (learned one) for his knowledge of the Guru Granth Sahib and public speaking skills. Influenced by the Indian independence movement, he joined the Praja Mandal, an affiliate of the Indian National Congress, advocating for democratic reforms in Faridkot. His activism led to imprisonment in solitary confinement from 1938 to 1943 for leading flag satyagrahas and forming a parallel government. During this period, inspired by his ordeals, he changed his name from Jarnail Singh to Zail Singh. Post-release, he continued peasant agitations against princely rule.

      "value": "After India's independence in 1947, Singh played a pivotal role in integrating princely states into the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). He served as Revenue Minister (1949‚Äì1951) and Agriculture Minister (1951), implementing land reforms that redistributed excess land to tenants and marginalized farmers, significantly benefiting Punjab's rural economy. Elected to the Rajya Sabha (1956‚Äì1962) and Punjab Legislative Assembly (1962‚Äì1967), he rose through Congress ranks, becoming President of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (1966). As Chief Minister of Punjab (1972‚Äì1977), he established India's first semiconductor unit in Mohali, enacted the Punjab Land Reforms Act (1972), and secured reservations for Mazhabi Sikhs and Valmikis in education and jobs. He also repatriated Udham Singh's remains for state honors. At the national level, as Union Home Minister (1980‚Äì1982), he managed internal security amid rising Punjab tensions. His presidency (1982‚Äì1987) involved ceremonial duties but included scrutiny of executive actions during crises like Operation Blue Star. (Sources: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki; cross-verified dates)"
