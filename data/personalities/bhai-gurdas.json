      "value": "Bhai Gurdas was born in 1551 into a Bhalla Khatri family at Goindval, Punjab (though some sources suggest Basarke Gillan). He was the only child of Bhai Ishar Das (youngest brother of Guru Amar Das) and Mata Jivani. Orphaned by age 12‚Äîhis mother died when he was three and his father soon after‚Äîhe was adopted and raised by his uncle, Guru Amar Das, at Goindval and Sultanpur Lodhi. Under the Guru's patronage, he received a comprehensive education in Sanskrit, Braj Bhasha, Persian, and Punjabi. He studied Hindu and Muslim literary traditions and delved into scriptures in Varanasi. Bhai Gurdas began preaching Sikhism early, embodying the era's spiritual fervor amid Mughal influences and Hindu reform movements. Social conditions in 16th-century Punjab involved caste rigidities and religious syncretism, which Sikhism sought to transcend."

      "value": "Bhai Gurdas was a dedicated sevadar (volunteer servant), contributing labor to excavate the Amritsar Sarovar in 1577 under Guru Ram Das. As a missionary, he traveled extensively‚Äîto Agra, Lucknow, Rajasthan, Jammu, Chamba hills, Kabul, Kashmir, and Varanasi‚Äîspreading Guru Nanak's teachings. He recited Sikh hymns to Emperor Akbar in 1596‚Äì97 at Kartarpur, impressing the emperor and dispelling claims of anti-Muslim content (prompted by rivals like Prithi Chand). During Guru Hargobind's imprisonment in Gwalior (1612‚Äì1619), he led Sikhs in support and later preached in distant regions, including an unverified expedition to Sri Lanka. His service extended to education, teaching young Guru Tegh Bahadur classics, archery, and horsemanship alongside Baba Buddha."

      "value": "Bhai Gurdas did not initiate reforms himself but supported Sikh institutionalization. He aided in compiling and authenticating the Adi Granth, standardizing Sikh scripture against oral traditions and external influences. As Jathedar of Akal Takht (from 1606), he helped establish it as a temporal authority, symbolizing Sikh sovereignty amid Mughal persecution. His writings reinforced Sikh principles of equality, devotion, and ethical living, countering caste and ritualism."

His independent works include:  \n  - *Varan Bhai Gurdas*: 40 Vaars with 912 Pauris in Punjabi, praised by Guru Arjan as the \"key\" to the Guru Granth Sahib. These vars elucidate Sikh philosophy, history, and ethics through vivid poetry.  \n  - *Kabit Savaiyye*: 672 Kabits and 3 Swayyas in Braj Bhasha, plus 6 Chhands in Sanskrit (discovered additions in 1939 by Bhai Vir Singh).  \n  His style is vigorous and metaphorical, blending philosophy with historical narrative, influencing Sikh exegesis."

As Jathedar, he upheld Akal Takht's authority during rising Mughal-Sikh tensions. Never married, he devoted his life to Sikhism. He passed away on 25 August 1636 (Bhadon Sudi 5, 1693 Bikrami) at Goindval, with Guru Hargobind performing his funeral rites.
