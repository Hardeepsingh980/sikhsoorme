      "value": "Ujjal Dosanjh was born on September 9, 1947, in Dosanjh Kalan, a village in the Jalandhar District of Punjab, India, shortly after India's independence from British rule. His family background instilled an early interest in politics; his father supported Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress, while his grandfather, Moola Singh Bains, was a freedom fighter and socialist who ran a local primary school. Despite his father's wish for him to become a doctor, Dosanjh pursued political science. At age 17, in 1964, he emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he learned English and worked as an assistant editor for a Punjabi-language newspaper. In 1968, he moved to Canada, settling in British Columbia with his aunt. He completed a Bachelor of Arts in political science and earned a law degree from the University of British Columbia in 1976, being called to the bar in 1977. Dosanjh worked manual labor jobs initially and taught English as a second language while building his career (Wikipedia, 2023)."

In politics, he entered provincial politics in 1991 as a BC NDP MLA for Vancouver-Kensington, serving until 2001.
