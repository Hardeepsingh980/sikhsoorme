      "value": "Gurcharan Singh Tohra was born on September 24, 1924, in the village of Tohra in Patiala District, Punjab, into a Sikh family of Tiwana Jats. As an agriculturalist, he developed an early interest in Sikh religious and political affairs. Even before India's partition in 1947, Tohra was an active participant in the Akali movement, which sought greater autonomy for Sikhs. He graduated in Punjabi from Lahore University and became the General Secretary of the Patiala unit of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in 1947. During the 1940s and 1950s, he worked at the grassroots level, forging connections with diverse political figures, including communists like Harkishan Singh Surjeet, though he remained committed to Akali ideology. His first imprisonment came in 1945 during the Riyasti Praja Mandal Movement in Nabha, marking the start of his lifelong involvement in agitations for Sikh and Punjabi rights."

      "value": "Tohra's most significant contributions were to Sikh religious institutions and Punjab politics. He became acting president of the SGPC in 1972 following the death of Sant Chanan Singh and was formally elected president in November 1972. Under his leadership, the SGPC‚Äîthe \"mini-parliament of the Sikh community\"‚Äîmanaged key gurdwaras and promoted Sikh education and welfare. He was imprisoned multiple times for his activism: in 1950 for advocating a popular government in PEPSU, in 1955 and 1960 during Punjabi Suba agitations, in 1973 for the Kisan agitation in Haryana, and during the 1975 Emergency under MISA. In the 1980s, he played a pivotal role in the Dharam Yudh Morcha and was present during Operation Blue Star (1984), where he attempted negotiations on behalf of Sikh leaders. Politically, he served five terms in the Rajya Sabha (1969‚Äì1976, 1980, 1982, 1998, 2004) and one term in the Lok Sabha (1977‚Äì1979). Tohra co-drafted the Anandpur Sahib Resolution (1973), demanding greater autonomy for Punjab. He is credited with rebuilding the Akal Takht after its damage in Operation Blue Star, restoring its symbolic importance to Sikhs."

Reformed SGPC administration by integrating grassroots Akali workers and expanding its influence over Sikh religious education and gurdwara management. Advocated for the Punjabi Suba (linguistic state of Punjab), contributing to the state's reorganization in 1966. Promoted Sikh political unity through alliances within the Akali Dal, though his hardline stance often led to internal conflicts. (Note: Some critics allege commercialization of kar seva and influence of non-traditional elements in SGPC, but these remain debated.)"

      "value": "In the late 1990s, Tohra's relationship with SAD leader Parkash Singh Badal deteriorated, leading to his ouster as SGPC president in 1999 and the formation of the Sarv Hind Shiromani Akali Dal. This split weakened the Akali Dal in the 2001 Punjab elections. By 2003, reconciliation efforts brought him back as SGPC president. Tohra suffered a massive heart attack on March 25, 2004, and was airlifted to New Delhi for treatment. He passed away on April 1, 2004, at age 79 due to cardiac arrest. His death was mourned widely, with tributes from Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who lauded his public service. He was survived by his wife, Joginder Kaur."
