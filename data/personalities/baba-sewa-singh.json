      "value": "Baba Sewa Singh was born on March 15, 1960, in Amritsar, Punjab, India. Little is documented about his early years, but his roots in Punjab, a region central to Sikh history, likely influenced his lifelong commitment to Sikh heritage and community service. Growing up in a socio-religiously rich environment, he developed a deep connection to Sikh principles of seva (selfless service), which became the foundation of his work. As a young man, he immersed himself in religious and social activities, eventually rising to lead Kar Seva initiatives at Khadur Sahib, a historic Sikh site associated with Guru Angad Dev Ji.

His environmental efforts began in 1999 with a tree plantation campaign, resulting in over 650,000 trees planted in public spaces, roadsides, schools, hospitals, and villages in Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, and Mumbai. He established a nursery in Khadur Sahib producing over 200,000 saplings annually, focusing on oxygen-rich, medicinal, fruit-bearing, and shade-giving species like Neem, Jamun, Tulsi, Banyan, and Peepal. In 2019, he launched the Guru Nanak Memorial Forests project, aiming for 550 dense forests by planting 50 tree varieties each‚Äî231 completed to date. He promotes eco-friendly practices, including horticulture for farmers and jute bags to reduce plastic use. In education, he founded 11 institutions under Kar Seva and Nishan-E-Sikhi Charitable Trust, educating over 8,000 students, including programs for competitive exams, women's defense training (527 placements), NDA preparation (14 successes), and religious studies. He also supports sports through the Baba Uttam Singh National Hockey Academy, producing national-level players like Akashdeep Singh."
