      "value": "Autar Singh Paintal was born on September 24, 1925, in Mogok, British Burma (present-day Myanmar), to a Punjabi Sikh family. His father, Man Singh, was a physician who had graduated from Rangoon Medical College after migrating from Pandori village in Amritsar district, Punjab, following a family tragedy during a bubonic plague epidemic. His mother, Rajwans Kaur, was the daughter of a general in the army of the Maharaja of Kapurthala. The family had six children, with Paintal being the eldest. Due to his parents' frequent moves, Paintal's early education was nomadic: he attended St. Paul's School in Rangoon (Yangon), St. Peter's in Mandalay, Kingswood in Kalaw, and later Khalsa High School in Lahore after 1939, where he was sent to live with an aunt amid fears of Japanese invasion during World War II. In 1943, the family relocated to Lucknow, India. Paintal studied at Forman Christian College, Lahore, before earning his MBBS and MD in Physiology from King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow in 1948. He pursued a PhD in Edinburgh University, Scotland, under a Rockefeller Fellowship, supervised by David Whitteridge, completing it in 1953."

He rose to become a professor and later served as Director of the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, University of Delhi (1971‚Äì1983). In 1971, he was appointed the first Principal of the University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS), Delhi, where he played a pivotal role in establishing it as a premier institution for medical education and research. From 1986 to 1994, he served as Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), overseeing national health research priorities. Paintal was also the founder president of the Society for Scientific Values, promoting ethical standards in Indian science. His research focused on cardiopulmonary physiology, leading to groundbreaking work on sensory mechanisms in the heart, lungs, and muscles."
