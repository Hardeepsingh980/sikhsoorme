      "value": "Baba Banda Singh Bahadur was born on October 27, 1670 (or October 16 per some sources), in Rajouri, Jammu, to a poor Rajput family as Lachman Dev. His father, Ram Dev, was a farmer. From a young age, Lachman excelled in hunting, horsemanship, wrestling, archery, and swordsmanship. At age 15, a traumatic hunting incident‚Äîkilling a pregnant doe and witnessing her unborn fawns die‚Äîprofoundly affected him, leading him to renounce worldly life and become an ascetic. He adopted the name Madho Das Bairagi after meeting the sadhu Janaki Prasads and established a monastery at Nanded on the Godavari River. There, he practiced meditation and tantric arts, attracting followers. In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh visited his dera during a hunt with Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah I. Impressed by the Guru's spiritual power, Madho Das submitted, declaring himself the Guru's \"banda\" (slave). Baptized with Khanda di Pahul, he was renamed Banda Singh Bahadur and tasked with leading the fight against Mughal tyranny in Punjab (Wikipedia; SikhiWiki)."

      "value": "Banda Singh's primary contribution was militarizing the Sikh resistance post-Guru Gobind Singh's passing in 1708. Commissioned with five arrows, a nagara (drum), and a hukumnamah (edict), he arrived in Punjab in 1709, rallying Sikhs and peasants oppressed by Mughal rule. He organized the Khalsa into a fighting force, issued coins, and established administrative centers. His campaigns sacked tyrannical strongholds like Samana (November 1709) and defeated Wazir Khan at the Battle of Sirhind (May 12, 1710), avenging the martyrdoms of Guru Gobind Singh's sons and mother. Banda expanded Sikh influence across Punjab, from the Sutlej to Yamuna rivers, mobilizing Hindus, Jats, Gujars, and Sikhs. His leadership fostered unity against Mughal persecution, setting the stage for future Sikh sovereignty (SikhiWiki; Wikipedia)."

    {
      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Banda Singh revolutionized Punjab's socio-economic structure by abolishing the zamindari (feudal landlord) system, granting land ownership directly to tillers and peasants. This empowered the lower castes and rural masses, redistributing wealth from Mughal elites. He appointed Sikh governors (e.g., Baj Singh at Sirhind) and issued orders under his seal from Lohgarh (his capital, formerly Mukhlispur). Revenue collectors (tahsildars) and police (thanedars) were established, promoting justice and ending practices like forced cow slaughter. These reforms symbolized the advent of \"Satyug\" (age of truth) as per his hukumnamahs, fostering equality and self-rule (Khafi Khan's accounts via SikhiWiki; Ganda Singh's Life of Banda Singh Bahadur)."

These emphasized Sikh ethics, prohibiting intoxicants and promoting unity (SikhiWiki)."

      "value": "After initial successes, Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah (d. 1712) and successor Farrukhsiyar launched relentless campaigns. Banda evaded capture in Shivalik hills, marrying a hill chief's daughter and regrouping. By 1715, imperial forces under Abdus Samad Khan besieged him at Gurdas Nangal for eight months. Starved and low on supplies, internal disputes (e.g., with Baba Binod Singh) led to surrender on December 17, 1715. Paraded through Lahore and Delhi in chains, Banda and 740 Sikhs endured public humiliation. On June 9, 1716, after watching his four-year-old son Ajay Singh tortured and killed, Banda himself was blinded, dismembered with hot pincers, and beheaded‚Äîremaining stoic throughout (Eyewitness accounts in Ibratnama by Muhammad Qasim; SikhiWiki)."
