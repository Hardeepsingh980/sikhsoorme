      "value": "Bhai Ram Singh was born on August 1, 1858, into a Ramgarhia Sikh family in Rasulpur village, near Batala in the Gurdaspur District of Punjab. His father, Assa Singh, was a skilled carpenter from the traditional Ramgarhia artisan community, facing financial hardships that led the family to relocate to Amritsar. As a child, Ram Singh displayed prodigious talent; by age 13 (circa 1871), he repaired and polished the piano of Lady Young, wife of the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, impressing British officials. Lacking formal early education, he apprenticed in carpentry at Amritsar's timber market (Cheel-Mandi). In 1873, he joined the Lahore School of Carpentry, which merged into the newly founded Mayo School of Arts in 1875. Under Principal John Lockwood Kipling (father of Rudyard Kipling), Ram Singh honed his skills in drawing, design, and architecture, becoming Kipling's prot√©g√©. By 1881, he contributed to practical projects, blending Sikh craftsmanship with emerging colonial influences (Sources: SikhiWiki \"Bhai Ram Singh and Khalsa College\"; Vandal, P. & S., *The Raj, Lahore and Bhai Ram Singh*, 2006)."

Starting as an assistant drawing master at Mayo School, he rose to Principal (1910‚Äì1913). His designs integrated Mughal, Sikh, and European elements in the Indo-Saracenic style, often collaborating with contractor Sir Ganga Ram and Kipling. Key contributions include:  \n- Architectural designs for public buildings, emphasizing load-bearing brickwork, ornate brick detailing, domes, chatris, and jali screens.  \n- Educational reforms: As Principal, he promoted Indian art education, training students in woodcarving, metalwork, and architecture while preserving Punjabi motifs.  \n- International work: Decorated Bagshot Park (1885) for the Duke of Connaught and the Durbar Room at Osborne House (1890‚Äì1892) for Queen Victoria, earning royal patronage. Queen Victoria described him as \"a very intelligent, pleasant, nice man, a Seikh\" in her diaries (January 1891).  \n- Community service: His Sikh heritage influenced designs like Khalsa College, fostering Punjabi-medium education and cultural revival amid colonial suppression (Sources: Wikipedia \"Ram Singh (architect)\"; SikhiWiki PDFs; *Encyclopedia of Sikhism*, Harbans Singh, 1997)."
