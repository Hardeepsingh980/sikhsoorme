      "value": "Baba Bidhi Chand was born on April 26, 1579, into a Jat Sikh family of the Chhina clan in Sur Singh village, Lahore district. Sources vary slightly on his family origins; his father is identified as Bhai Vassan (or possibly Hindal, a devotee of Guru Amar Das), his grandfather as Bhai Bhikkhi, with his mother hailing from the village of Sirhali. As a young man, Bidhi Chand fell into bad company and became a notorious bandit in the turbulent Punjab region under Mughal rule. His life changed dramatically around the early 1600s when Bhai Adali, a pious Sikh from Chohia village, introduced him to Guru Arjan Dev. In the Guru's presence, Bidhi Chand experienced a profound spiritual transformation, renouncing his criminal ways and dedicating himself to Sikh service. He became a close devotee of Guru Arjan, embodying the Sikh ideals of redemption and devotion."

      "value": "Bidhi Chand's service to the Sikh Gurus was exemplary. In 1606, he was one of five trusted Sikhs selected to accompany Guru Arjan on his fateful journey to Lahore for martyrdom under Emperor Jahangir's orders. Following Guru Arjan's passing, Guru Hargobind initiated the militarization of the Sikh community to protect against Mughal persecution. Bidhi Chand was appointed as one of the first commanders of the Risaldari (cavalry) and later as one of the four pioneering leaders of the Akal Sena, the first standing Sikh army. He displayed remarkable valor in several battles against Mughal troops, including skirmishes during Guru Hargobind's confrontations at Amritsar and Kartarpur. Guru Hargobind honored him with the epithet \"Bidhi Chand Chhina Guru Ka Seena\" (Bidhi Chand Chhina is the chest of the Guru), symbolizing his unwavering loyalty and protective role. As a preacher, he propagated Sikh teachings, blending spiritual discourse with martial readiness."

There, he befriended the Muslim saint Sundar Shah of Devnagar, whose attachment to him was so deep that Bidhi Chand promised to return in his final days. True to his word, as his health declined, Bidhi Chand sought permission from Guru Hargobind and traveled to Devnagar. He and Sundar Shah spent three days in profound reflection on Guru Nanak's teachings before passing away together on August 14, 1640. Sundar Shah was buried per Muslim rites, while Bidhi Chand was cremated per Sikh tradition. Shrines were erected for both, and later, Bidhi Chand's son Lal Chand retrieved sacred earth from the site to build a samadh in Sur Singh village."
