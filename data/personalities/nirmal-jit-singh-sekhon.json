      "value": "Nirmal Jit Singh Sekhon was born on 17 July 1943 in the village of Isewal (Rurka Isewal), Ludhiana District, Punjab, into a Jat Sikh family during British India. His father, Tarlok Singh Sekhon, was a Warrant Officer (Honorary Flight Lieutenant) in the Indian Air Force, providing a military upbringing that instilled discipline and patriotism. His mother was Harbans Kaur Sekhon. Sekhon pursued education in Punjab and developed an early interest in aviation, influenced by his father's service. He joined the Indian Air Force and was commissioned as a Pilot Officer on 4 June 1967, undergoing training to become a fighter pilot. By 1971, he was acclimatizing to high-altitude operations in Kashmir, despite the harsh winter conditions, as no air defense aircraft were permanently based in Srinagar per the 1948 Indo-Pak agreement until hostilities began."

      "value": "Sekhon served with distinction in the Indian Air Force's No. 18 Squadron, nicknamed \"The Flying Bullets,\" flying the Folland Gnat‚Äîa lightweight British fighter jet known for its agility in dogfights. Stationed at Srinagar Air Base during the 1971 war, he was part of the air defense setup for the Kashmir Valley. Throughout the conflict, he and his squadron repelled multiple Pakistani intrusions, upholding the Gnat's reputation. His service highlighted the IAF's role in protecting strategic assets amid escalating border tensions. Sekhon's ultimate contribution came on 14 December 1971, when he single-handedly engaged a superior enemy force, preventing further damage to the airfield and surrounding areas."

Despite ongoing strafing and bombing, he took off in his Gnat, engaging six F-86 Sabre jets from Pakistan's No. 26 Squadron. He downed or damaged at least two before being overwhelmed, crashing in a gorge near Srinagar. His remains were never located despite extensive searches by the Army and Air Force, due to the rugged terrain. He was 28 years old at the time of his martyrdom."

  "spiritualLegacy": {
    "description": "As a proud Sikh, Sekhon's life and sacrifice embodied core Sikh principles from the Guru Granth Sahib, such as *dharam yudh* (righteous war), courage (*bahadur*), and selfless service (*seva*). His Jat Sikh background connected him to Punjab's martial traditions, where Sikhs have historically defended the vulnerable. Honored in Gurdwaras and Sikh narratives, he is remembered as a modern *Sant-Sipahi* (saint-soldier), inspiring Sikh youth to uphold values of bravery and equality in service to the nation.",

High-altitude Kashmir operations challenged pilots unacclimatized to cold and terrain.

It boosted IAF morale, proved Gnat's efficacy against superior foes, and cemented Sikh valor in Indian history; Pakistani pilot Salim Baig Mirza later praised his skill."
