      "value": "Bhai Bidhi Chand was born on April 26, 1579 (citation needed for exact date; approximate from historical estimates), into a Jat Sikh family of the Chhina clan in the village of Chhina (or Sur Singh), located in the Lahore district of historical Punjab (modern-day Pakistan/India border region). His father was Bhai Vassan (or Hindal, per some sources), a devotee of Guru Amar Das, and his grandfather was Bhai Bhikkhi. His mother hailed from the village of Sirhali. As a young man, Bidhi Chand fell into bad company and led a life of banditry and misdeeds in the turbulent socio-political environment of Mughal-ruled Punjab. This changed dramatically around the early 1600s when Bhai Adali, a pious Sikh from the village of Chohia, introduced him to Guru Arjan Dev. In the Guru's presence, Bidhi Chand underwent a profound spiritual transformation, renouncing his former life and dedicating himself to Sikh service. He became a close disciple of Guru Arjan, absorbing Sikh teachings on equality, devotion, and righteous living."

      "value": "Bidhi Chand's service began under Guru Arjan, whom he accompanied as one of five chosen Sikhs during the Guru's fateful journey to martyrdom in Lahore in 1606. Amid rising Mughal persecution, Guru Hargobind (Guru Arjan's successor) militarized the Sikh community to protect its followers, establishing the Akal Sena‚Äîthe first standing Sikh army. Bidhi Chand was appointed as one of the first four commanders of the cavalry (Risaldari) and served as the inaugural Commander-in-Chief in Guru Hargobind's absence during battles. He displayed exceptional valor in multiple skirmishes against Mughal forces, including defenses around Amritsar and Kiratpur. His most celebrated contribution was the daring rescue of two exceptional horses, Dilbagh (later renamed Jan Bhai, meaning \"dear as life\") and Gulbagh (renamed Suhela, meaning \"dear companion\"), which had been seized by Mughal officials en route from Kabul as offerings for Guru Hargobind. Disguising himself first as a humble grass-seller named \"Kasera\" to gain access to the Lahore Fort stables, and later as an astrologer to outwit the guards, Bidhi Chand stealthily swam the horses across the Ravi River under cover of night‚Äîtwice‚Äîafter lulling the sentries with feasts and distractions. This feat not only recovered the prized steeds but symbolized Sikh ingenuity and defiance against oppression. Additionally, Guru Hargobind blessed him with the title \"Guru Ka Seena\" (the Guru's chest), signifying his unyielding loyalty and protective role."

      "value": "In his later years, Bidhi Chand was dispatched by Guru Hargobind from Kiratpur on a preaching mission to the eastern provinces of India (likely Bengal and Bihar regions). There, he deeply influenced a Muslim saint, Sundar Shah of Devnagar, fostering interfaith harmony through discussions on Guru Nanak's teachings. Honoring a promise, as his death approached, Bidhi Chand sought permission from Guru Hargobind to fulfill his commitment to Sundar Shah. He traveled to Devnagar, where the two spent three days in spiritual reflection. Both passed away simultaneously on August 14, 1640. Sundar Shah was buried per Muslim rites by his disciples, while Bidhi Chand was cremated according to Sikh traditions. Shrines were erected for both. Later, Bidhi Chand's son, Lal Chand, retrieved sacred earth from the site and built a samadh (memorial) in the family village of Sursingh."
