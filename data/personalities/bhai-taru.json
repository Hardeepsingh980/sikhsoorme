      "value": "Bhai Taru Singh was born on October 6, 1720, in Poohla (also spelled Poolha or Puhia) village near Amritsar, Punjab, into a Sandhu Jatt Sikh family. His father, Bhai Jodh Singh, died in battle when Taru was young, leaving his mother, Bibi Dharam Kaur, to raise him and his younger sister, Bibi Tar Kaur, as a widow. The family lived modestly, practicing the Sikh faith amid Mughal persecution. Taru worked as a farmer, tilling small plots of land and growing maize. He was known for his piety, frugality, and adherence to Guru Gobind Singh's teachings, including maintaining uncut hair (kesh) as a symbol of Sikh identity. As a young man, he witnessed Mughal forces attempting to abduct a poor girl, only to be thwarted by Sikh fighters. This event inspired him to formally join the Khalsa, committing to the Sikh code of conduct."

      "value": "During the 1730s‚Äì1740s, under the oppressive rule of Mughal Governor Zakaria Khan, Sikhs faced severe persecution, including bans on farming, trade, and worship. Bhai Taru Singh and his family secretly aided Sikh revolutionaries (gursikhs) hiding in jungles and deserts, providing food, clothing, and resources from their farm earnings. Despite not being wealthy, they lived sparingly‚Äîeating coarsely ground meals and wearing homespun clothes‚Äîto support their brethren. His sister Tar Kaur assisted in grinding corn and preparing provisions. This service exemplified the Sikh principle of seva (selfless service) and dasvandh (tithing 10% of earnings to the community), sustaining the Khalsa Panth during a time of exile and guerrilla resistance against Mughal forces."

      "value": "In the early 1740s, informant Akil Das (also known as Harbhagat Niranjania) spied on Taru Singh's activities and reported him to Zakaria Khan for treason. Arrested alongside his sister, Taru refused bribes or pleas for release. Imprisoned and tortured in Lahore, he was brought before the governor, where he boldly proclaimed \"Waheguru ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru ji ki Fateh\" (The Khalsa belongs to God, victory belongs to God). Offered freedom if he converted to Islam and cut his hair, he refused, stating his strength came from his kesh blessed by Guru Gobind Singh. On June 9, 1745, in a public spectacle at Naulakha Bazaar, Lahore, his scalp was torn off with a blade, preventing hair regrowth. Left to bleed in prison, Sikh lore recounts that Zakaria Khan suffered agony and died 22 days later after striking himself with Taru's shoes, as per Taru's curse. Taru Singh passed away on July 1, 1745, at age 24‚Äì25. His body was cremated outside Delhi Gate, Lahore."
