      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Harvinder Sahota was born on April 15, 1941, in Basti Tankawali, a village near Ferozepur in Punjab, India, to parents Lachman Singh and Dhan Kaur. Originally named Iqbal at birth, his life took a dramatic turn at the age of five when he suffered a severe medical setback and was briefly declared dead. Revived by a physician, the event was interpreted as a \"second birth,\" leading to his name being changed to Harvinder, meaning \"lord of hearts\" in Punjabi‚Äîa fitting moniker given his future career in cardiology. Growing up in rural Punjab during the post-Partition era, Sahota's early experiences in a modest Sikh family instilled values of resilience and service, core tenets of Sikhism. He pursued medical education in India before migrating to the United States, where he established himself as a pioneering cardiologist (sources: Wikipedia; cross-verified with biographical books like *A Hero of American Hearts* by Gurmukh Singh)."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",

      "value": "Sahota's career spans decades of innovation in interventional cardiology. In 1985, he invented the \"Sahota Perfusion Balloon,\" a device that allows continuous blood flow to the heart during angioplasty, reducing patient discomfort and procedural risks. This FDA-approved invention, now used globally, marked a significant advancement in treating coronary artery disease. He holds 24 patents, including innovations like red laser light therapy to prevent restenosis, multi-lobe balloons, fibrin-coated stents, and hemostats for controlling bleeding during procedures. Sahota performed pioneering coronary angioplasties in various countries: the first in North India (Chandigarh, 1990), as well as in Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, and multiple U.S. hospitals. He has served as vice chairman and chairman of the Orange County Emergency Medicine Commission in California, research director at Metro Hospital Heart Institute in New Delhi, and advisory board member in Tbilisi, Georgia. Currently, he sits on the board of directors at Claremont Lincoln University, promoting interfaith and ethical leadership (sources: Wikipedia; *The Sikhs Unlimited* by Khushwant Singh)."

    {
      "label": "Key Reforms",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Sahota's work reformed angioplasty by introducing perfusion technology, which minimized ischemia (lack of blood flow) during procedures, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes. His inventions addressed critical limitations in earlier balloon catheters, such as chest pain from temporary blockages. Additionally, his advocacy for accessible cardiac care in developing nations, including training programs in India, democratized advanced treatments. As a Sikh in the diaspora, his efforts align with the Sikh principle of *seva* (selfless service), extending medical aid to underserved populations (sources: Wikipedia; Global Indian Congress recognition, 2003)."
