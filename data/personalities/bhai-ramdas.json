He is believed to have been born in the mid-17th century in the Punjab region, possibly in or near Ramdas village, which was a significant Sikh center. Ramdas was likely influenced by the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh and became an initiated member of the Khalsa during the Guru's lifetime. His devotion to the Sikh faith developed amidst the turbulent times of Mughal-Sikh conflicts.

      "value": "After the passing of Guru Gobind Singh in 1708, the Sikh community faced existential threats from Mughal forces under Emperors like Bahadur Shah and later Farrukhsiyar. Bhai Ramdas emerged as a key figure in organizing and sustaining the Sangat. He traveled across Punjab, holding gatherings (diwans) to recite from the Guru Granth Sahib, perform kirtan, and reinforce the principles of the Khalsa. His efforts helped prevent fragmentation within the community during a time when many Sikhs were forced into hiding or conversion. He is credited with establishing or supporting small gurdwaras and langars in rural areas, fostering a sense of brotherhood (citationNeeded). Bhai Ramdas also mediated disputes among Sikh factions, promoting unity under the guidance of the Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal Guru."
