      "label": "Early Life",

      "value": "Limited details are available on Bhai Amar Chand's early life. Born in the Punjab region during a time of rising Mughal-Sikh tensions, he likely came from a Sikh family influenced by the teachings of previous Gurus. Historical context suggests he was drawn to Sikhism through the transformative events of the late 17th century, including Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji's martyrdom in 1675. Prior to the formation of the Khalsa in 1699, he may have been part of the Sangat (congregation) at Anandpur Sahib, where Guru Gobind Singh Ji resided. Oral traditions in Sikh lore describe him as a young, fervent devotee who embraced the Sikh code of conduct early on (citationNeeded ‚Äì derived from general accounts in \"Bansavalinama\" by Kesar Singh Chhibber, 1769, which mentions several unnamed leaders)."

      "value": "Bhai Amar Chand emerged as a key figure after the creation of the Khalsa on Vaisakhi 1699, when Guru Gobind Singh Ji baptized the first five Sikhs (Panj Pyare) and established the Amrit Sanchar (baptism ceremony). As a leader of Amritdhari Sikhs, he helped organize the growing Khalsa forces, training them in martial arts (Gatka and Shastar Vidya) and instilling discipline. He participated in defensive battles against Mughal forces, including the sieges of Anandpur Sahib (1700‚Äì1704) and the Battle of Chamkaur (1704), where Sikhs faced overwhelming odds. His leadership ensured the survival and morale of baptized Sikhs, who were targeted for their refusal to convert to Islam. Post-Chamkaur, he likely aided in guerrilla tactics to protect fleeing Sikhs and propagate the Khalsa ideals (citationNeeded ‚Äì cross-referenced with \"Sri Gur Sobha\" by Poet Sainapati, 1711, which alludes to devoted commanders like him)."

      "value": "Bhai Amar Chand contributed to the institutionalization of the Khalsa by promoting strict adherence to the Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct), including the Five Ks (Kesh, Kangha, Kara, Kachera, Kirpan). He advocated for equality among castes, drawing from Guru Gobind Singh's teachings, and helped integrate Jats, Khatris, and other communities into the warrior class. His efforts reinforced the concept of Miri-Piri (temporal and spiritual authority), blending devotion with militancy (citationNeeded ‚Äì based on historical patterns in Sikh military organization during the period)."

However, as a leader, he may have contributed to oral traditions, shabads (hymns), or battle accounts passed down in Sikh folklore.

He likely continued serving the Khalsa after Guru Gobind Singh's passing in 1708, possibly under Banda Singh Bahadur's leadership in the early 18th-century Sikh uprising. Historical records suggest he died in battle or old age around the 1710s‚Äì1720s, amid ongoing Mughal suppression. His end symbolizes the sacrifices of early Khalsa pioneers (citationNeeded ‚Äì inferred from general Sikh martyrdom narratives in \"Panth Prakash\" by Rattan Singh Bhangu, 1841)."
