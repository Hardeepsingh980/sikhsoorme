      "value": "Ravi Singh was born on September 16, 1969, in the United Kingdom to Punjabi Sikh parents (citationNeeded for exact birthplace; likely Slough or nearby based on early affiliations). Growing up in a Sikh family, he was deeply influenced by the principles of Seva (selfless service) and the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, particularly the concept of Sarbat da Bhalla (welfare of all humanity). In the late 1990s, as a member of the Singh Sabha Gurdwara committee in Slough (1998‚Äì1999), Singh became involved in community service. The upcoming tricentennial of the Khalsa in 1999 sparked his vision to extend Sikh humanitarian ideals globally. Witnessing the Kosovo refugee crisis on news reports, he was moved by the suffering of war victims, leading to the inception of Khalsa Aid. This marked the transition from local volunteerism to international activism."

      "value": "Singh founded Khalsa Aid in 1999 as a UK-registered charity (No. 1080374), starting with an aid convoy to Albania for Kosovo refugees. Under his leadership, the organization has grown into a global force, providing immediate relief and long-term rehabilitation in over 50 countries. Key efforts include:  \n- Delivering aid to earthquake victims in Haiti (2010), Turkey, and Orissa, India (post-cyclone).  \n- Supporting flood relief in Pakistan (2005, 2008), Punjab, India (2008), and multiple Indian states (2019).  \n- Assisting refugees in war zones, such as Somalia (2003), Bangladesh (2007), and Rohingya camps (2017).  \n- Pioneering langar (community kitchen) setups in ISIS-affected areas of Syria (2015) and Iraq (2016), aiding Yazidi families despite risks.  \n- Responding to natural disasters like the Nepal Earthquake (2015, nearly 9,000 deaths) and Kerala floods (2018).  \n- During the COVID-19 pandemic, Khalsa Aid under Singh fed NHS workers in the UK and provided rations to the poor in India (2020‚Äì2021).  \n- Recent work includes Ukraine refugee support (2022‚Äìongoing).  \nSingh's hands-on approach, often leading teams into danger zones, has mobilized thousands of volunteers worldwide, emphasizing non-discriminatory aid rooted in Sikh ethics. He has also addressed domestic crises, like the 2014 Somerset floods in the UK and 2016 Dover traffic aid distribution (6,000 water bottles)."

      "value": "Singh has reformed humanitarian aid delivery by integrating Sikh practices like langar into modern relief operations, ensuring culturally sensitive, volunteer-driven models. He advocated for community empowerment, such as art therapy for children in Indonesia and school rehabilitation in Orissa. Notably, in 2018, he declined the 'Indian of the Year' nomination to assert his identity as Punjabi/Khalsa, sparking discussions on diaspora identity and avoiding nationalistic labels in global service. His work promotes interfaith harmony, as seen in collaborations with local NGOs in Pakistan and Albania."
