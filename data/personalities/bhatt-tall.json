      "value": "Little is known about Bhatt Tall's personal life due to limited historical records. The Bhatts were a group of Saraswat Brahmin poets and bards from northern India, particularly associated with Kashmir and Punjab regions. They were Vaishnav devotees who traveled as wandering minstrels, composing praises for spiritual figures. Bhatt Tall, along with other Bhatts like Kalshar, Gayand, and Nalh, likely encountered Guru Nanak and his successors during their travels in the mid-16th century. They sought a true saint after years of searching, eventually finding fulfillment in the Sikh Gurus (citation: SikhiWiki - Bhatt Bani)."

      "value": "Bhatt Tall is credited with composing Swayyas (a poetic metre) included in the Guru Granth Sahib under Bhattan de Savaiye (123 verses total by 11 Bhatts). These are panegyrics eulogizing the first five Sikh Gurus: Nanak, Angad, Amar Das, Ram Das, and Arjan. The Bhatts' works were incorporated by Guru Arjan during the compilation of the Adi Granth in 1604. Bhatt Tall's specific contribution is one Swayya, but scholars debate its authenticity, suggesting it may be a scribal error for compositions by Bhatt Kalshar (who sometimes signed as 'Kal' or 'Tal'). The Bhatts served as historical chroniclers, maintaining Bhat Vahis (genealogical records) and praising the Gurus' divine qualities (citation: Wikipedia - Writers of the Guru Granth Sahib)."

Themes include the Gurus as divine incarnations (e.g., linking Guru Nanak to Ram and Krishna) and the efficacy of Guru's grace for emancipation.
