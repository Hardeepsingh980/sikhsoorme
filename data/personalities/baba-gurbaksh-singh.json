      "value": "Baba Gurbaksh Singh was born on April 10, 1688 (Baisakh Vadi 5, 1745 Bikrami), in the village of Lil in the Amritsar district of Punjab, to parents Dasaundha Singh (father) and Mai Lachchami (mother). His family relocated to Anandpur Sahib in 1698, where he witnessed the formative years of the Khalsa. On the historic Vaisakhi day of 1699, he was initiated into the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, adopting the Sikh code of conduct and martial ethos. He received advanced religious education under the tutelage of Bhai Mani Singh Ji, a prominent Sikh scholar and martyr. This period instilled in him a deep commitment to Sikh principles of faith, equality, and resistance against oppression. As a young Khalsa warrior, he joined the Shaheedan Misl (Martyrs' Confederacy), a key Sikh military order, initially serving under the legendary Baba Deep Singh Ji. [Source: Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]"

      "value": "Baba Gurbaksh Singh rose to prominence as a fearless leader in the Sikh resistance against Mughal and Afghan invaders during the turbulent 18th century. After Baba Deep Singh's martyrdom in 1757, he organized his own jatha (fighting band) within the Shaheedan Misl, often leading the vanguard in battles. His dera (camp) became renowned for its gallantry, carrying the Sikh banner into combat and inflicting significant losses on enemy forces. He participated in numerous skirmishes that helped expand Sikh territories in Punjab, including defenses against Afghan incursions. His service exemplified the Sikh ideal of dharam yudh (righteous war), protecting pilgrims, gurdwaras, and the community from persecution. In the broader context, his efforts contributed to the weakening of Afghan control over Punjab, paving the way for Sikh sovereignty. [Source: SikhiWiki; Ratan Singh Bhangu's Prachin Panth Prakash]"

      "value": "In late 1764, during Ahmad Shah Abdali's seventh invasion of India, Baba Gurbaksh Singh was stationed at the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. With Sikh forces retreating to avoid a decisive battle, he chose to remain with 29 companions‚ÄîNihal Singh, Basant Singh, Man Singh, and others‚Äîto defend the sacred site. The Afghan-Baloch army, numbering around 30,000 under Abdali and ally Nasir Khan, entered Amritsar unopposed on December 1, 1764. Dressed as a bridegroom with garlands and sword in hand, symbolizing his eagerness to \"marry\" death (as per Sikh martyr symbolism), Baba Gurbaksh Singh led a daring attack on the invaders at the parikrama (circumambulatory path) of the Golden Temple. Despite the overwhelming odds, the 30 Sikhs fought valiantly, killing many foes before all were martyred. Eyewitness accounts describe their fearless charge, spilling enemy blood in defense of the faith. His body was cremated behind the Akal Takht, where the Shaheed Ganj memorial now stands.

    "politicalSituation": "Punjab was a battleground for Mughal remnants and Afghan invasions under Ahmad Shah Abdali (Durrani Empire). The Sikh Misls (confederacies) were emerging as decentralized guerrilla forces challenging imperial control after Guru Gobind Singh's establishment of the Khalsa in 1699. Abdali's seventh invasion (1764) aimed to reassert dominance after Sikh occupations of Lahore and Multan.",
    "socialConditions": "Religious persecution of Sikhs included temple desecrations (e.g., Harmandir Sahib demolished in 1762). Sikhs faced forced conversions, taxation, and massacres, fostering a culture of martyrdom and communal defense. Rural Jat communities like Gurbaksh Singh's provided resilient recruits for the Khalsa.",
    "significance": "Baba Gurbaksh Singh's stand preserved Sikh morale and sacred sites, contributing to the eventual Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It underscored the shift from defensive guerrilla warfare to organized resistance, symbolizing Sikh sovereignty.
