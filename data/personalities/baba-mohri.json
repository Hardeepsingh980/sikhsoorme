      "value": "Baba Mohri was born on June 2, 1539, in Basarke Gillan village, near Amritsar, Punjab, to Guru Amar Das and Mata Mansa Devi. As part of the Bhalla gotra of the Khatri tribe, he grew up in a family deeply rooted in Vaishnavite traditions before his father's conversion to Sikhism in 1539. His father, Guru Amar Das, became the third Sikh Guru in 1552, when Mohri was about 13 years old. Mohri was the younger of two sons, following his brother Mohan (born 1536). Little is documented about his childhood, but the family resided in Basarke before moving to Goindval during his father's guruship. The socio-religious environment was one of transition under Mughal rule, with Guru Amar Das establishing key Sikh institutions like the Manji system."

      "value": "Unlike his elder brother Mohan, who led a reclusive life focused on study and contemplation in Goindval, Baba Mohri was of an active disposition. He spent much of his time assisting in the management of Guru Amar Das's household and supporting the growing Sikh community. His service exemplified the Sikh principles of selfless devotion (seva), contributing to the daily operations of the Guru's establishment in Goindval. Historical accounts note his unquestioning acceptance of family and community decisions, reflecting humility and loyalty."

Sikh tradition highlights his positive stance on the guruship successions: he accepted his brother-in-law Bhai Jetha (later Guru Ram Das) as the fourth Guru without protest, and later rejoiced at the nomination of Guru Arjan (son of Bibi Bhani) over his nephews Prithi Chand and Mahadev, as recorded in Sarup Das Bhalla's *Mahima Prakash*. His death date remains unrecorded, likely in the late 16th or early 17th century."
