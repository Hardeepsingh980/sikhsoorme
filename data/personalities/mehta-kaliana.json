      "value": "Limited historical records exist on Bhai Mehta Kaliana's early life, as is common for many early Sikh figures not among the Gurus or central companions. He was born into a prosperous Khatri merchant family in the 16th century, likely in the Punjab region during the Mughal era. The social conditions of the time were marked by religious syncretism, with Bhai Mehta Kaliana emerging as an early convert to the Sikh faith under the influence of Guru Amar Das (1479‚Äì1574). As a merchant (mehta denoting a title for traders), he amassed wealth through trade, which later played a pivotal role in his devotion. Historical context suggests he resided in or near Goindwal Sahib, a key center established by Guru Amar Das to foster Sikh community life away from caste hierarchies.

During the construction of the Baoli (stepwell) at Goindwal Sahib‚Äîa monumental project symbolizing equality and spiritual access for all‚ÄîGuru Amar Das called upon his disciples to contribute resources. Bhai Mehta Kaliana, known for his piety, offered his entire fortune without hesitation, declaring it all in service of the Guru's vision. This act exemplified the Sikh principle of dasvandh (tithing) and selfless giving (vand chakna). He also participated in the langar (community kitchen) operations, ensuring sustenance for pilgrims and workers. His devotion strengthened the early Sikh organizational structure, helping establish Goindwal as a spiritual hub. Cross-verification from Sikh oral traditions and texts like the Gurbilas literature highlights his role in promoting Guru Amar Das's reforms against social inequalities."

His contributions aligned with the Guru's efforts to centralize Sikh authority and foster inclusivity in a period of Hindu-Muslim tensions under Mughal rule (citationNeeded for direct involvement in manji; inferred from era-specific accounts)."

He likely continued his seva in Goindwal Sahib until his natural death sometime after the Baoli's completion (circa 1550s‚Äì1570s). Following Guru Amar Das's passing in 1574, he may have aligned with the subsequent Gurus, but no specific mentions exist. His end reflects the humble devotion of early Sikhs, passing without fanfare in service to the faith (citationNeeded; based on general patterns in Sikh historiography)."
