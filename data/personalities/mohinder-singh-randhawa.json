      "value": "Mohinder Singh Randhawa was born on February 2, 1909, into a Jatt Sikh family in Zira, Ferozpur District, Punjab, British India. His parents were Sher Singh Randhawa and Bachint Kaur, from an affluent background in Bodal village (near Garna Sahib), Dasuya, Hoshiarpur District. Growing up in a rural agrarian setting, Randhawa developed an early interest in botany and agriculture, influenced by Punjab's fertile lands and the challenges of farming.\n\nHe pursued his education at Khalsa High School in Muktsar, completing his matriculation in 1924. Randhawa then attended Government College, Lahore, earning an F.Sc. in 1926, BSc (Hons) in 1929, and MSc (Hons) in Botany in 1930. His postgraduate thesis focused on algae, particularly the Zygnemataceae family. In 1955, the University of the Punjab awarded him a Doctorate in Science (DSc) for his pioneering work on Indian algae (citation: University of the Punjab records; Wikipedia).\n\nRandhawa's early life coincided with the turbulent socio-political environment of British India, including the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919) and the Non-Cooperation Movement, which instilled in him a sense of national duty."

      "value": "Randhawa joined the Indian Civil Service (ICS) in 1934, serving in districts like Saharanpur, Faizabad, Almora, Allahabad, Agra, and Rae Bareli until 1945. His administrative acumen shone during World War II and the lead-up to independence.\n\nIn 1946, as Deputy Commissioner of Delhi, he oversaw the midnight session of the Constituent Assembly on August 14, 1947, where Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the \"Tryst with Destiny\" speech. Post-Partition (1947), Randhawa led rehabilitation efforts for millions displaced from West Pakistan. As Additional Director-General (1949) and later Director-General of Rehabilitation (Punjab, 1953), he managed land allotment for refugees, resettling over 1.5 million Punjabis and preventing famine through efficient resource distribution (citation: \"Out of the Ashes,\" Randhawa's 1954 publication; Government of Punjab archives).\n\nFrom 1955, as Vice-President and Secretary of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), he spearheaded agricultural reforms, introducing high-yield varieties and irrigation techniques that laid the foundation for India's Green Revolution (1960s). He advised the Planning Commission on natural resources (1961‚Äì1964) and served as Special Secretary, Ministry of Food and Agriculture.\n\nAs Chief Commissioner of Chandigarh (1966‚Äì1968), Randhawa contributed to its urban planning, landscaping with native trees, and establishing institutions like the Chandigarh Museum and Government Museum and Art Gallery. He founded Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana (1962) as its first Vice-Chancellor (1970s), advancing agricultural education.\n\nAn environmentalist, Randhawa initiated Van Mahotsav in 1950, promoting nationwide tree planting to combat deforestation post-Partition. He introduced exotic and indigenous species to Chandigarh, creating the iconic Zakir Hussain Rose Garden (Sector 16), home to over 1,600 rose varieties (citation: Chandigarh Administration records; Wikipedia).\n\nIn arts and culture, Randhawa documented Punjabi heritage through books on Kangra and Basohli paintings, establishing the Punjab Arts Council and Museum of Cultural Heritage in Ludhiana. He also oversaw the Anglo-Sikh War Memorial near Ferozepur (1976) (citation: Lalit Kala Akademi fellowship; personal publications)."
