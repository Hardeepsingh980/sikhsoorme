      "value": "Baba Sahib Singh Bedi was born on April 7, 1756 (Chet Sudi, traditional Punjabi calendar), in Dera Baba Nanak to Baba Ajit Singh Bedi (d. 1773) and Mata Sarupan Devi. As a lineal descendant of Guru Nanak Dev Ji‚Äîthe founder of Sikhism and progenitor of the Sodhi and Bedi clans‚Äîhe belonged to the Bedi lineage, tracing back through generations of Sikh preachers and custodians of Gurdwaras. His birth is traditionally said to have been prophesied by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the tenth Sikh Guru, emphasizing his destined spiritual role [citationNeeded]. In 1770, at age 14, his family relocated to Una in the Sivalik Hills (present-day Himachal Pradesh), where they owned land grants from earlier Sikh benefactors. This move placed him in a region of strategic importance during the turbulent 18th century, amid Mughal decline and rising Sikh resistance. Around 1774, at approximately 18 years old, he traveled to Anandpur Sahib, the spiritual stronghold of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. There, he was initiated into the Khalsa by Baba Sobha Singh, a direct disciple of the tenth Guru and Jathedar of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib from the Bhai Daya Singh Samparda. This Amrit Sanskar marked his commitment to Sikh ideals of equality, service, and martial discipline, shaping his lifelong role as a preacher and initiator."

      "value": "Baba Sahib Singh Bedi emerged as a unifying figure during the Sikh Confederacy (Misls) era (late 18th century), a period of fragmented Sikh warrior bands resisting Afghan and Mughal incursions. Respected by Sikh Misldars (chiefs) for his lineage and piety, he mediated disputes among rival factions like the Sukerchakia, Bhangi, and Kanhaiya Misls, fostering solidarity against external threats. His diplomatic efforts were instrumental in paving the way for the centralized Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1801, he applied the sacred tilak (forehead mark) and saffron paste during Ranjit Singh's coronation in Lahore on April 12, symbolizing divine sanction and legitimacy for the new Maharaja. As Rajguru (royal preceptor) of the Sikh Empire, he advised on spiritual and ethical matters, earning admiration from Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims alike. He founded Bedian (near Lahore) on land granted by Ranjit Singh, establishing a Sikh religious school to propagate Gurbani (Sikh scriptures) and counter the Mina sect‚Äîa heretical group led by descendants of Prithi Chand (elder brother of Guru Arjan Dev Ji), based nearby in Heir village. Through extensive travels, he preached the teachings of the Sikh Gurus, performed Amrit Sanskar for thousands, and promoted community service (seva) and ethical living, strengthening Sikh identity amid colonial pressures."

A notable event was his 1795 declaration of a \"Dharam Yudh\" (holy war) against Malerkotla, citing cow-killing and a historical grievance involving Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan's elopement with and conversion of a woman from Guru Gobind Singh Ji's family. The siege ended prematurely due to a personal injury (bullet wound), after which he withdrew across the Sutlej River, demonstrating restraint. By the 1820s‚Äì1830s, as the Sikh Empire stabilized, he focused on spiritual education and dera management. He passed away on July 17, 1834, in Una, at age 78, survived by sons Bishan Singh and Bikram Singh. His death marked the end of a pivotal transitional figure from the Misls to the imperial era."
