      "label": "Early Life",
      "icon": "",
      "value": "Narinder Singh Kapany was born on October 31, 1926, in Moga, Punjab, British India, into a Sikh Khatri family of the Sodhi clan. His family, landlords by heritage, claimed descent from Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh Guru, through the Guru's son Mohari. Around 1760, the family relocated to Nizamabad, Uttar Pradesh. Kapany completed his schooling in Dehradun, where a schoolboy challenge from a teacher‚Äîthat light travels only in straight lines‚Äîsparked his lifelong obsession with bending light. He graduated from Agra University in India before serving as an officer in the Indian Ordnance Factories Service (IOFS). In 1952, he pursued advanced studies at Imperial College London, earning a Ph.D. in optics from the University of London in 1955. His early experiments focused on image transmission through fiber bundles, conducted under a Royal Society grant alongside Harold Hopkins."

      "label": "Contributions/Service",

      "value": "Kapany's groundbreaking work in the 1950s laid the foundation for fiber optics. Collaborating with Hopkins, he achieved the first successful image transmission via large bundles of optical fibers in 1953, improving quality dramatically through innovative cladding techniques. Despite credit disputes‚Äîsuch as a rushed publication by Bram van Heel in 1954‚ÄîKapany's 1956 invention of a glass-coated rod protected light beams from environmental interference, enabling practical applications. He coined \"fiber optics\" in a 1960 *Scientific American* article and authored the field's first book. His innovations extended to lasers, biomedical instrumentation (e.g., flexible endoscopes for medical imaging), solar energy, and pollution monitoring. As an entrepreneur, he founded Optics Technology Inc. (1960, went public in 1967), Kaptron Inc. (1973, sold to AMP Inc. in 1990), and K2 Optronics. Academically, he served as Regents Professor at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz, directing the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Development (CIED). He published over 100 papers and lectured internationally."

      "label": "Key Reforms",

      "value": "Kapany reformed optics education and industry by popularizing fiber optics, which transformed global telecommunications, internet infrastructure, and medical diagnostics. He advocated for technology transfer and intrapreneurship, serving as Chief Technologist at AMP Inc. and on boards like the National Inventors Council. In philanthropy, he founded and funded the Sikh Foundation (over 30 years), promoting Sikh academia, arts, and publishing. He endowed the first Chair of Sikh Studies at UC Santa Barbara (1998) and a Chair of Opto-Electronics at UC Santa Cruz (1999), donating $500,000 to the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco for a Sikh art gallery. His efforts elevated Sikh heritage globally without chauvinism, emphasizing its universal wisdom."

He published over 100 scientific papers in journals like *Nature* and *Scientific American*. As a Sikh advocate, he contributed to publications through the Sikh Foundation, supporting translations and studies of Sikh texts. No Gurbani compositions, but his writings often reflected Sikh values of innovation and service (e.g., essays on Guru Tegh Bahadur's secular sacrifice)."

Kapany passed away on December 4, 2020, in Redwood City, California, at age 94, due to natural causes. Posthumously, he received India's Padma Vibhushan in 2021. His family includes son Rajinder (hi-tech executive) and daughter Kiren (attorney and filmmaker)."
