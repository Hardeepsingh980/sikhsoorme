      "value": "Bhai Mardana was born in 1459 into a Mirasi Muslim family in Rai Bhoi di Talwandi, which is now Nankana Sahib in Pakistan. He was the seventh child of Badra and Lakkho, all his older siblings having died at birth. He grew up in the same village as Guru Nanak Dev Ji and was about ten years his senior. Mardana developed a profound talent for music from a young age, particularly excelling in playing the rabab. Early accounts suggest that his family approached Guru Nanak seeking help due to the tragic deaths of their children, and Guru Nanak provided assurance, even giving Mardana his new, significant name. He initially sang hymns by various bhagats such as Kabir, Trilochan, Ravidas, Dhanna, and Beni."

      "value": "Bhai Mardana's most significant contribution was his unwavering companionship and musical service to Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He accompanied Guru Nanak on all his major spiritual journeys, known as the Udasis, which spanned across India and beyond. During these travels, Mardana would play the rabab while Guru Nanak sang the divine verses (Gurbani), creating a powerful and harmonious medium for spreading the Guru's message of monotheism, equality, and universal love. His musical accompaniment was not merely a performance but an integral part of the spiritual experience, helping to convey the depth and emotion of the Guru's teachings to diverse audiences. Mardana's role also served to demonstrate the interfaith harmony espoused by Guru Nanak, as a Muslim accompanying a Hindu-born spiritual master."

      "value": "While Bhai Mardana was not a reformer in the institutional sense, his life and close association with Guru Nanak Dev Ji inherently supported and exemplified the core reforms of early Sikhism. His presence, a Muslim playing music for a Guru who preached against caste and religious divisions, was a living embodiment of the universal brotherhood that Sikhism sought to establish. He helped to popularize the use of music (Kirtan) as a primary method of spiritual devotion and congregational worship, a practice that became a cornerstone of Sikh tradition."

      "value": "Bhai Mardana spent his final years with Guru Nanak at Kartarpur. Having aged and wearied from their extensive travels, he fell ill. Before his passing in 1534, the question of his funeral rites arose. Guru Nanak, emphasizing the irrelevance of worldly rituals for a soul liberated from ego, allowed Mardana to choose. Mardana, through the Guru's teachings, expressed detachment from his physical body, leaving the decision to Guru Nanak. He was a faithful minstrel and companion until his last breath. He passed away in Afghanistan, near present-day Kurram Agency."
