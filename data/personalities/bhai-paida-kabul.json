      "value": "Bhai Paida traveled from Kabul to Punjab to meet Guru Har Rai (1630‚Äì1661), the seventh Sikh Guru, at Kiratpur Sahib. Impressed by the Guru's humility and teachings on equality and devotion, he became a lifelong follower. He rendered selfless service (seva) in the Guru's langar (community kitchen) and assisted in daily affairs. During Guru Har Rai's tenure, Bhai Paida helped disseminate Sikh principles among diverse communities, including Pashtun and Afghan groups. When Guru Har Rai nominated his young son, Guru Har Krishan (1656‚Äì1664), as successor, Bhai Paida continued his service. In 1664, he accompanied the eight-year-old Guru to Delhi at the invitation of Emperor Aurangzeb, providing protection and support during the journey. In Delhi, amid Mughal intrigue, Bhai Paida aided in organizing sangat (congregations) and preaching the message of one God and social justice. His efforts helped establish Sikh presence in northern India."
