      "icon": "",
      "value": "Rattan Singh Bhangu was born around 1785 into the prominent Bhangu Jat Sikh family during the turbulent late 18th century in Punjab. He was the third of four sons born to Rai Singh (d. 1810), a Sikh leader from the Bhangu lineage, and his wife, the daughter of Sham Singh (d. 1739), founder of the Karor Singhia Misl‚Äîa powerful Sikh confederacy. His paternal grandfather, Mehtab Singh Bhangu (d. 1745), was a celebrated Sikh martyr who, alongside Sukha Singh, assassinated Massa Ranghar in 1740 for desecrating the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. This family heritage of resistance against Mughal oppression deeply influenced Rattan Singh's worldview and historical narratives. Raised in a warrior-aristocratic environment, he inherited a four-village estate (jagir) centered at Bharhi near Ludhiana. As a Nihang (order of warrior-Sikhs), he received traditional Sikh education, gaining access to key texts like the *Puratan Janam Sakhi* (1580s), Bhai Gurdas's *Vaaran* (pre-1630), Sainapati‚Äôs *Sri Gur Sobha* (pre-1710), and Sukha Singh‚Äôs *Sri Gur Bilas* (1797), alongside Persian, Sanskrit, and Braj Bhasha sources. His early life coincided with the consolidation of Sikh Misls and the rise of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's empire, fostering his commitment to documenting Sikh resilience [Wikipedia; SikhiWiki]."

      "value": "Rattan Singh's primary contribution was as a historian preserving Sikh oral traditions during a period of transition from decentralized Misl rule to centralized Sikh sovereignty under Ranjit Singh. In 1809, while traveling to his estate, he learned of British East India Company efforts to document Sikh history through the Persian scholar Bute Shah, whom he criticized as biased and uninformed. Approaching Captain William Murray (1791‚Äì1831), the British liaison in Ludhiana, Rattan Singh offered an authentic Sikh perspective. Their meetings, starting in 1809, involved verbal recitations of Sikh history, which Rattan Singh later committed to writing at night. This interaction bridged colonial curiosity with indigenous knowledge, countering potential distortions. As a member of the Sikh aristocracy with firsthand knowledge of Khalsa struggles, he traveled extensively, interviewing veterans and collecting accounts. His work emphasized the martial ethos of the Sikhs, their egalitarian Khalsa identity, and critiques of internal divisions, such as those involving Banda Singh Bahadur [Wikipedia; Research_For_Personality]."

      "value": "Rattan Singh's magnum opus is *Sri Gur Panth Prakash* (later titled *Prachin Panth Prakash* to distinguish it from Giani Gian Singh's 19th-century work). Composed in homely Punjabi verse using meters like dohra and chaupai, it spans 163‚Äì199 sakhis (narratives) and is divided into two parts: the human Gurus' era (from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh's death in 1708) and the post-Guru period (1708 onward, focusing on Banda Singh Bahadur's campaigns, Sikh persecutions, and Misl formations). The text draws heavily from family oral histories, emphasizing Majha Sikhs' valor and critiquing deviations like Banda's alleged alterations to Khalsa practices (e.g., red banners, vegetarianism). Manuscripts date to ca. 1810‚Äì1813, with completion around 1841 in Amritsar's Sham Singh bungƒÅ. First printed in 1914 by Bhai Vir Singh (who edited out references to Hindu elements for Singh Sabha-era purity), a fuller edition appeared in 2004 edited by Balwant Singh Dhillon. The work remains a foundational source for 18th-century Sikh history, detailing battles, martyrdoms (e.g., Bhai Mani Singh, Taru Singh), and events like the Vadda and Chhota Ghallugharas [SikhiWiki; Wikipedia on Panth Prakash]."

      "value": "In his later years, Rattan Singh continued refining *Panth Prakash* amid the Anglo-Sikh tensions leading to the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845‚Äì1846). He died on 10 February 1846, reportedly at the Battle of Sobraon‚Äîone of the war's decisive engagements where Sikh forces suffered heavy losses against the British. His death marked the end of an era for traditional Sikh chroniclers rooted in Misl traditions, just as British influence grew in Punjab [Wikipedia; citationNeeded for battle death]."
