      "value": "Mai Bhago was born into a devout Jat family in Jhabal Kalan, located in the present-day Tarn Taran district of Punjab. Her family had a strong Sikh lineage; her grandfather, Bhai Pero Shah, was the younger brother of the esteemed Bhai Langah, who converted to Sikhism during the time of Guru Arjan Dev. Her father, Malo Shah, was a soldier in Guru Hargobind's army, and it was in this environment that Mai Bhago received training in Shaster Vidya (the science of arms). As a young girl, she had the opportunity to visit Anandpur Sahib and receive darshan (glimpse) of Guru Gobind Singh. She later married Bhai Nidhan Singh of Patti."

      "value": "Mai Bhago's most significant contribution was her unwavering courage and leadership during a critical period in Sikh history. In 1704-1705, during the Mughal siege of Anandpur Sahib, a group of 40 Sikhs from her region, demoralized by the harsh conditions, deserted Guru Gobind Singh, signing a document disavowing him. Mai Bhago was deeply distressed by this act of desertion. She openly criticized them, shaming them into reconsidering their actions. Through her powerful persuasion, she rallied these 40 Sikhs (the \"Chali Mukte\") and other faithful Sikhs, leading them to seek out Guru Gobind Singh. They intercepted an approaching imperial Mughal army near the dhab (pool) of Khidrana (Muktsar). Mai Bhago, clad in warrior attire and wielding her sword, fought fiercely alongside these Sikhs, inflicting heavy casualties on the Mughal forces and forcing them to retreat."
