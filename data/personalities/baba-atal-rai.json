      "value": "Baba Atal Rai was born in 1619 in Amritsar to Guru Hargobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, and Mata Mahadevi (also referenced as Mata Nanaki in some sources; cross-verification needed ‚Äì SikhiWiki specifies Mata Mahadevi, daughter of Bhai Daya Ram Marwah of Mandeala). From a young age, he displayed exceptional intelligence, liveliness, and deep religiosity, earning the honorific \"Baba\" (meaning wise elder) despite his youth. He was particularly fond of his father, who often cuddled him and cautioned against displaying spiritual powers frivolously. Atal enjoyed playing with peers near Kaulsar Sarovar, a pool built in memory of Bibi Kaulan, and served as their natural leader due to his boldness and wisdom. His conversations, even in play, carried profound humane insights, fostering respect among companions."

      "value": "Though his life was short, Baba Atal Rai's primary contribution was exemplifying Sikh values through his actions. He demonstrated spiritual prowess by reviving his friend Mohan, who had died from a snakebite, by touching him with a bat and invoking \"Satnam Waheguru.\" This act, while miraculous, highlighted themes of compassion and faith. However, it led to his self-imposed departure, teaching the Sikh community the importance of humility and non-interference with divine will. His legacy inspired the construction of Gurdwara Baba Atal, a site for communal service including langar (free community kitchen) distribution."

Chastened, the nine-year-old Atal bathed in the sacred sarovar, circumambulated Harmandir Sahib four times, and sat by Kaulsar Sarovar. There, contemplating the Guru Granth Sahib, he recited Japji Sahib and peacefully departed on July 23, 1628. His body was cremated at the site, and Guru Hargobind instructed no mourning, affirming, \"All those who are born must die. Such is the Almighty‚Äôs Will.\""
