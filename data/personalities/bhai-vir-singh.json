      "value": "Bhai Vir Singh was born on December 5, 1872, in Amritsar, Punjab, into a prominent Sikh family. He was the eldest of three sons of Dr. Charan Singh, a noted Braj poet, Punjabi prose-writer, musicologist, and community leader involved in Sikh restoration efforts. His paternal grandfather, Baba Kahn Singh (1788‚Äì1878), was a recluse who trained in traditional Sikh learning at monasteries in Haridwar and Amritsar, later becoming proficient in Sanskrit, Braj, and oriental medicine. Vir Singh's maternal grandfather, Giani Hazara Singh (1828‚Äì1908), was a leading scholar at the Gianian Bunga in Amritsar, known for translating Persian classics like Saadi's Gulistan into Punjabi and compiling a lexicon of the Guru Granth Sahib. The family traced its ancestry to Diwan Kaura Mall (d. 1752), a vice-governor of Multan under the Mughals.  \n  At age 17, Vir Singh married Chatar Kaur, daughter of Sardar Narain Singh of Amritsar; they had two daughters. His early education combined traditional Sikh scriptures (Gurbani) with Persian, Urdu, and Sanskrit under tutors like a Muslim Maulawi and Giani Harbhajan Singh. He attended the Church Mission School in Amritsar, passing his matriculation in 1891 with first place in the district. Experiences with Christian missionary conversions among classmates strengthened his Sikh convictions, inspiring him to use literature for Sikh propagation. [References: Wikipedia, SikhiWiki]"

      "value": "Vir Singh dedicated his life to Sikh revivalism during British colonial rule, when Sikhs faced cultural assimilation and persecution (e.g., forced hair-cutting of officials). In 1894, at age 22, he co-founded the Khalsa Tract Society to publish affordable Punjabi tracts on Sikh theology, history, and reforms, countering Hindu and Christian influences. He launched the Punjabi weekly *Khalsa Samachar* in 1899, serving as its editor for decades, and acquired the Wazir Hind Press to print Singh Sabha literature. He co-promoted key institutions: Chief Khalsa Diwan (1902), Sikh Educational Conference (1908), and Punjab and Sind Bank (1908). Avoiding direct politics, he focused on education and community development, editing old Sikh texts like *Sikhan di Bhagat Mala* (1912) and *Puratan Janam Sakhi* (1926). His efforts helped redefine Sikh identity amid movements like Nirankari and Namdhari. [References: SikhiWiki, Wikipedia]"

      "value": "Vir Singh advocated for Sikhism's distinct identity, rejecting its absorption into Hinduism or Christianity. He reformed Punjabi literature by shifting from Braj Bhasa to vernacular Punjabi, creating modern prose and poetry forms (e.g., adapting English blank verse into Sirkhand). Through tracts and *Nirguniara* journal, he promoted social reforms like widow remarriage, inter-community harmony, and anti-superstition campaigns. His novels idealized 18th-century Sikh heroism, inspiring resilience. He revised Giani Hazara Singh's *Sri Guru Granth Kosh* (1927) and annotated Bhai Santokh Singh's *Suraj Prakash* (1927‚Äì1935), standardizing Sikh exegesis. These reforms bridged traditional Sikh heritage with modernism, aiding assimilation of Western influences without diluting core tenets.

He received a doctorate in Oriental Learning from Panjab University and was nominated to the Punjab Legislative Council in 1952. Health declined in early 1957 due to lifelong overwork; he passed away on June 10, 1957, in Amritsar at age 84. His unfinished commentary was published posthumously.
