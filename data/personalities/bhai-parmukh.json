As a kirtani, he likely grew up in a Sikh family environment where devotion to Gurbani was central. Kirtanis traditionally trained under established ragis (musical exponents of Sikh scriptures), suggesting Parmukh may have received informal education in classical raags and Sikh musical traditions from gurdwaras in Punjab or diaspora communities. No specific birth date or place is recorded in available references, but modern era kirtanis often emerged in the 20th century amid the Sikh revival movements. (citationNeeded for specific details)"

      "value": "Bhai Parmukh is noted for his efforts in popularizing Sikh hymns (kirtan), making Gurbani accessible to wider audiences through live performances and recordings. In the modern context, kirtanis like him helped bridge traditional Sikh worship with contemporary settings, performing in gurdwaras, samagams (religious gatherings), and possibly early radio broadcasts or community events. His service likely involved teaching aspiring singers and preserving the melodic structures (raags) prescribed by the Sikh Gurus for hymn recitation. This contributed to the cultural preservation of Sikh music during times of social change, such as post-partition India or global Sikh diaspora expansion."
