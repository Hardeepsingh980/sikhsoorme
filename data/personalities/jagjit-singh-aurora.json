      "value": "Jagjit Singh Aurora was born on 13 February 1916 into an Arora Sikh family in Kala Gujran, a village in the Jhelum District of Punjab Province, British India (present-day Punjab, Pakistan). His father was an engineer, providing a stable upbringing in a region marked by colonial influences and religious diversity. Aurora pursued a military education at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun, graduating in 1939. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British Indian Army's 1st Battalion, 2nd Punjab Regiment on 1 February 1940. This early training instilled discipline and prepared him for active service during World War II, where he participated in the Burma Campaign against Japanese forces (1942‚Äì1945).

      "value": "Aurora's illustrious career spanned multiple conflicts. Post-independence in 1947, he opted for the Indian Army amid the Partition of India and served in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 in Kashmir, commanding infantry units. Promoted to Brigadier in 1957, he led reconnaissance missions, including to Bhutan in 1961, which facilitated Indian military training programs there. During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, he commanded a brigade in border skirmishes. By 1964, as a Major General, he served as Director of Military Training. In the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, he contributed to defensive operations. Appointed Deputy Chief of Army Staff in 1966 and GOC of a corps in 1967, Aurora's pinnacle came in 1969 when he became GOC-in-C of the Eastern Command. His most significant service was in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War: anticipating conflict after Pakistan's Operation Searchlight and the refugee crisis (nearly 10 million Bengalis fleeing to India), Aurora orchestrated logistical preparations, including infrastructure upgrades and supply movements. He coordinated with the Mukti Bahini (Bangladeshi guerrilla forces), training and equipping them for sabotage operations that weakened Pakistani defenses. On 3 December 1971, following Pakistani airstrikes on Indian airfields, Aurora launched a multi-pronged offensive, bypassing strongholds to encircle Dhaka rapidly‚Äîcrossing the Meghna River via improvised boat ferries under cover of night. This strategy minimized casualties and led to victory in just 13 days, with Pakistani forces surrendering en masse.
