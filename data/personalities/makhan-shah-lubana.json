      "value": "Baba Makhan Shah Lubana was born around July 7, 1619 (23 Harh 1676 Bikrami), into a devout Sikh family of the Lubana tribe. His father, Bhai Dasa Labana (also called Hardev Ji or Desu Ji), was a follower of Guru Hargobind, the sixth Guru. His mother was Mata Bijay Devi (or Vijey Devi). As a descendant of Bhai Banna through Bhai Artha and Bhai Binai, he was raised in a trading environment. Scholars debate his birthplace: Max Arthur Macauliffe, G.S. Chabra, and Sukha Singh favor Kathiawad, Gujarat, where Lubanas (also called Lohanas) were prominent traders. Others, like Giani Gian Singh, suggest Tanda (possibly in Kashmir or Punjab), but Col. Gurbachan Singh refutes this due to multiple \"Tanda\" locations lacking evidence. Educated in Vijaynagar, he mastered Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and foreign languages like Portuguese and English from his travels, though his native Labanki (a Punjabi dialect) was his primary tongue. From youth, he assisted in family trade, inheriting skills in commerce. Bhatt Vahis record his early association with Sikhism, including hosting Guru Hargobind during travels to Kashmir around 1626."

His actions ensured smooth Guru succession amid Mughal-era challenges and impostors."

He died in 1674 (1731 Bikrami) in Village Raja Harpal, Sialkot, leaving his wife Bibi Sital Devi and son Bhai Lal Das. His death marked the end of a life blending worldly success with spiritual devotion."

    "description": "Baba Makhan Shah Lubana's legacy is that of a faithful Sikh whose ingenuity and devotion safeguarded the Guru's lineage during a critical succession crisis. In the 17th-century Mughal-dominated Punjab, where Sikh Gurus faced persecution and rival claimants, his story underscores themes of true recognition through divine insight (parchi), fulfilling vows (vrat), and selfless service (seva). The Gurdwara Manji Sahib and Bhora Sahib at Baba Bakala commemorate his role, attracting pilgrims annually. His proclamation \"Guru Ladho Rae!\" symbolizes triumphant faith. Institutions like the Baba Makhan Shah Labana Foundation continue his spirit of community service and heritage preservation.",
